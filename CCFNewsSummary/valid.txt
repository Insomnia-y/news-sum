' a group of 20 christian leaders chose to accept the new rules , isis claim . many christians fled after isis started attacking and burning churches . under a new set of brutal rules outlined by isis , they are banned from owning weapons and from selling pork or wine to muslims or drinking wine in public . punishments will also be issued to those who renovate churches , display crosses or other religious symbols , ring church bells or pray in public . it is believed isis is trying to implement an extreme interpretation of islamic law . the group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the nusra front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in syria . in july , a commander of the fsa was reportedly shot dead by isis fighters in the coastal province of lattakia . there were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of idlib . late last year , reports started to emerge of friction with other islamists . in november 2013 , isis was accused of killing a prominent member of the syrian islamist rebel group ahrar al-sham . in the most recent sign of continuing tension , isis suffered losses in two days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in aleppo and idlib provinces . more than 2,000 people are believed to have been killed since western-backed and islamist groups attacked isis-occupied cities at the start of this year .	 warning graphic content : islamist group live-tweeted punishment of a thief in northern syria .   photos were posted online showing a man having his hand chopped off .   group claimed the man requested the punishment to ` cleanse him of sin '

5	the former head of the military , lord richards , pictured , has hit out at government defence cuts . the former head of the military has hit out at the government 's defence cuts , saying they could leave britain with an army more suited to a ` banana republic ' . lord richards of herstmonceux , who stood down last summer , said the reduced numbers of regular soldiers would be ` a problem ' if the country was involved in another long-running conflict . in a separate swipe at defence secretary philip hammond , he said he respected him , but suggested he was not ` clubbable ' , and said that he would ` never make a soldier ' . and lord richards said he had disagreed with the strategy of cutting soldier numbers and relying increasingly on reservists - claiming he was not involved in the decision , which was taken out of his hands . around 20,000 soldiers will be cut over the next four years in the largest redundancy programme ever attempted , coinciding with the end of britain 's 13-year campaign in afghanistan . but the peer - formerly general sir david richards -- warned that a failure to retain quality people in the army , navy and air force would be disastrous for the long term future of the forces . ` you will always have an army or armed forces . every country does ' , he said . ` the difference between the british armed forces and those of most other countries , and i 've come across many , is the quality of our people . we do n't pay them brilliantly by any means . only now , when i 'm outside , do i realise for the first time what people can be paid . ` but because we look after them and because it 's socially at every level acceptable to be in the army . whether you are a private in the greenhouse from yorkshire , or the heir to the throne , or you are a captain in some smart organisation , the fact is there is a consensus that it 's a good to be in the armed forces . ` if you lose that because you do n't look after your people well , you will have an army , a navy and an air force , but it will be the sort of army , navy and air force with which we do n't associate with the british , that you associate with banana republics ultimately . ' lord richards said defence secretary philip hammond , pictured , would ` never make a soldier ' lord richards commanded the armed forces in afghanistan in 2006-7 and was made chief of the defence staff in 2010 . cutting the numbers of soldiers to 82,000 meant on similar sustained campaigns ` they yes , we would have a problem . our regular soldiers would have to go back more frequently than is desirable . ' this would be a long-term problem , but by 2020 , he said , ` the british forces will look very impressive , will still be the second biggest spender in nato and after the americans we will be the most capable . ' while he added that he would always wonder if people would feel he let the forces down by allowing soldiers to be made redundant , he had felt it was crucial to get the economy back on track . as to relying on reservists , he said this decision was taken out of his chain of command , and he had argued for smaller cuts . in his maiden speech to the house of lords this week , lord richards said britain 's armed forced would need more resources to deal with the global threat of jihadis , and called for defence spending to increase as the economy starts to grow or the forces ' effectiveness ` will inevitably deteriorate ' .	 lord richards of herstmonceux has hit out at government 's defence cuts .   reducing soldier numbers ' a problem ' in the event of long-running conflict .   ex military chief says defence secretary philip hammond would ` never make a soldier ' 
6	president obama has sent a special unit of cia officers to the uk to investigate british muslim extremists amid growing fears in washington that we are becoming a ` breeding ground ' for terrorism . in a pointed snub to mi5 , the agents arrived on a ` lone wolf ' mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of uk muslims . the mission has been revealed as our security services have been forced to admit they are struggling to keep track of the estimated 500 britons who have travelled to the middle east to fight alongside the islamic isis forces in syria and iraq . snub : barack obama has sent a special unit of cia officers to the uk to investigate british muslim extremists . it is unusual for the cia to send a team to the uk : the agency usually relies on information passed to it by mi5 or mi6 or by its agents stationed at the american embassy in london . sources have told the mail on sunday that the agents were keen to establish the ` stability ' of the relationship between the sunni and shia branches of muslims in the uk . the fighters going out to join isis have been british-based sunnis , causing deepening tensions within the community . professor anthony glees , of the centre for security and intelligence studies at buckingham university , said the mission , which took place earlier this year , showed the level of concern in washington over the issue , which he claimed was rooted in the uk 's ` lax ' immigration policies . ` the us is worried about the british situation . they fear there might be a knock-on effect for them , ' prof glees said . ` the throat-cutting between sunnis and shias in iraq and syria has not yet spread to the uk , but it is a real threat . it is conceivable you could see shia `` hit squads '' in britain targeting sunnis preparing to go out to the conflict zones to fight . ' he said : ` the americans regard the uk as a disaster because of our lax stance on immigration which has allowed this militancy to take hold . radicalised : former promising cardiff students reyaad khan -lrb- left -rrb- and nasser muthana -lrb- right -rrb- in an isis video . ` frankly , they would not be doing their jobs properly if it did not do this -- forming an objective view of the situation outside of the reports they get from mi5 and their officers at the us embassy in london . ' last night a source at the cia insisted british intelligence had been informed of ` all outside contacts ' the agents made in the uk . however , the sources also admitted that the move revealed a growing lack of trust in washington over mi5 and mi6 's ability to provide a reliable assessment of the security threat presented by young muslims under the sway of imams who are radicalised and then recruited to fight in religious wars around the globe . the obama administration has become increasingly anxious that young american muslims could follow the same pattern . there are strong links between british and american radicals and the sources say the cia feels british efforts to identify and unmask them have been inadequate . a cia and a home office spokesman declined to comment .	 sources said u.s. agents want to assess stability of muslim relations in uk .   normally obama relies on intelligence passed directly from the british .   but fears have ramped up after recent radicalisation of young britons .

' the dgse revelations will now leave mr hollande looking , at best , incredibly naieve , and at worst extremely hypocritical . france 's seven other intelligence services , including domestic secret services and customs and money-laundering watchdogs , have access to the dgse data , writes le monde . britain is said to have a similar spying programme on international phone and internet traffic , and is said to share personal information with the american nsa . a spokesman for the dgse in paris refused to comment directly on le monde 's report .	 manual valls was guest of honor at ambassador charles rivkin 's party .   told hundreds of guests that such practices ` do not have their place between allies and partners '   comes amid revelations french security agents illegally spy on residents .   will embarrass french president who has been vocal in criticism of u.s.

12	blow : canadian environment minister peter kent announced his country was withdrawing from the kyoto protocol last night . canada has abandoned the kyoto protocol on climate change as it bids to protect the third largest oil reserves in the world . environment minister peter kent said canada was invoking the legal right to withdraw and would be saving the country $ 14billion in penalties for not achieving its kyoto targets . the conservative government is reluctant to hurt canada 's booming oil sands sector - which holds more than 170 billion barrels - with daily production expected to more than double by 2025 . canada becomes the first nation to formally renounce the protocol , although japan and russia have also indicated they would not accept new kyoto commitments after the protocol expires at the end of 2012 . mr kent said : ` the kyoto protocol does not cover the world 's largest two emitters - the u.s. and china - and therefore can not work . ` it 's now clear that kyoto is not the path forward to a global solution to climate change . if anything it 's an impediment . ` to meet the targets under kyoto for 2012 would be the equivalent of either removing every car , truck , atv , tractor , ambulance , police car and vehicle of every kind from canadian roads or closing down the entire farming and agriculture sector and cutting heat to every home , office , hospital , factory and building in canada . ' currently , canada produces 1.5 million barrels from the oil sands a day . only saudi arabia and venezuela have more reserves . critics say the enormous amount of energy and water needed in the extraction process increases greenhouse gas emissions , meaning canada will only be more likely to fall foul of the carbon dioxide targets in the future . there is also the possibility that further global warming could make it easier to extract the oil in hard-to-access areas where the arctic conditions make it difficult to drill or strip out . target : the protocol required 37 countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas output to 1990 levels by the end of next year -lrb- file picture -rrb- . mr kent 's announcement comes a day after marathon climate talks finished in the south african city of durban . negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed on a deal that sets the world on a path to sign a new climate treaty by 2015 to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires at the end of next year . canada 's previous liberal government signed the accord , but current prime minister stephen harper 's conservative government has never accepted it . the accord requires countries to give a year 's notice to withdraw . much heralded : then prime minister jean chretien received a standing ovation after the protocol was ratified in 2002 . kyoto did not include the u.s. or china . the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 in japan and ratified by most major countries except the u.s. and china . it only came into force in february , 2005 . it committed 37 industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels and provided financial help to developing countries to accomplish the task . although canada ratified the accord , it was not on track to meet its targets as emissions climbed while the economy expanded . the protocol will continue to be in effect until the end of 2012 , despite canada quitting . while many city authorities in canada approved the decision , others accused the government of destabilising future action on global warming . greenpeace canada spokesman mike hudema said in a written statement the harper government ` has imposed a death sentence on many of the world 's most vulnerable populations by pulling out of kyoto ' . he added : ` this is a further signal that the harper government is more concerned about protecting polluters than people . ' new democratic party environment critic megan leslie said the costs for canada to say in koyoto were ` absolutely made up ' . she told cbcnews : ` what this is really about is the fact that our government is abdicating its international obligations . ` it 's like we 're the kid who 's failing the class so we have to drop it before that happens . '	 canada becomes first nation to renounce protocol against global warming .   country was not on track to meet greenhouse gas targets and faced $ 14bn in penalties .   kyoto protocol expires at the end of 2012 and new treaty is expected to be drawn up by 2015 .   agreement signed in 1997 did not include u.s. or china .   critics accuse government of ` abdicating international obligations '

' other ways to pronounce it include ` bin ' in most other country and ` bean ' in british tourist destinations . if your answer is ` ya 'll , ' then chances are very good you . were raised south of the mason-dixon line . other responses included ` you all , ' used mostly in kentucky and a chunk of central florida , and you guys , which is . basically used everywhere else . not included in the map is the uniquely pittsburgh . alternative ` yinz guys . ' just say pjs : nearly following the ` ya 'll line ' is the pajama line . southerners and a few folks in the northeast call their jammies ` puh-jaaahmas ' while the rest of the country prefers their nightwear to be ` puh-jam-uhs ' or is it parkway ? debate rages about whether that ` big road you drive fast on ' is a freeway or a highway , with westcoasters leading toward freeway . is your lawyer loyal ? regardless , if the first syllables of the words sound the same to you , you 're probably not from the south , where lawyer rhymes with callyer . mary me merry and we 'll be marry : if you hear this sentence and it makes sense , you 're like most of america . but in some regions , people pronounce each word differently . a less obvious example is the word ` caramel . ' though sweet , . preference for how to pronounce the sugary treat seems to create a bitter . divide according to katz 's map . travelers to montana be warned : the state . reported the most who pronounce it ` carm-uhl , ' without the second ` a. ' crayon jewels : ` cray-un , ' ` cray-awn , ' ` cran , ' or ` crown , ' they all mean crayon . fifty fifty : about half the country calls the eggy dressing man-aise , while the others prefer the extra zip in the middle , calling it may-uh-naise . circular logic : only in new england are rotaries more than those volunteer retirees with tents at fairs -- they 're traffic circles in most of the country , while utah calls them roundabouts . other questions include the perennial favorite ` pop ' or ` soda , ' how to pronounce ` pecan , ' and the question that will annoy every louisianan who . reads the maps , ` what do you call the miniature lobster the one finds in lakes . and streams ?

' i think people are being a little bit harsh on manchester united at the moment . they are not as bad as people think because they are in a good position , and if they get in the top four a few people are going to have to recognise they have done better than people expected .

22	chelsea will probably know by now that they called it wrong . they were on trial as much as christian eriksen when one of europe 's most hyped young talents turned up in cobham as a 14-year-old for the first of two visits . it might just sting jose mourinho on sunday that neither side quite fancied the other , chelsea thinking the boy ` too weak ' , to quote the player 's father , and eriksen himself ruling that the club 's academy set-up was not as embracing or enticing as that offered by ajax . what an intriguing quirk of fate that scrawny eriksen grew into a player more than capable of dictating how this capital one cup final will be won . christian eriksen was one of tottenham 's few bright performers in their europa league defeat by fiorentina . the denmark international has revealed he was rejected by chelsea as a 14-year-old trialist . eriksen eventually chose to join the youth academy at ajax before going on to star for the first team . the dane will have an important part to play when tottenham face chelsea in sunday 's capital one cup final . ` england was not my first choice at that age , ' eriksen admitted this week , recalling the trips from odense to london , first at 14 and then 15 for games against millwall and west ham . ` i enjoyed myself but it was too big a step at that time . in england you ca n't enter the training ground without permission whereas in denmark you are free to go in . ajax was a lot closer to home and it meant my mum could come over for my first month . it was an easy decision . ' he signed for ajax at 16 and joined tottenham as an # 11million player in 2013 . in the wider scheme of the club 's spending in recent years , he might just be the best of the lot . he is the playmaker in the tight spaces , an attacking midfielder with enough sense of purpose that he has scored 16 goals in 51 premier league games . as spurs flopped out of europe on thursday , eriksen still managed to look good . the talented playmaker has netted nine premier league goals from midfield this season . mauricio pochettino -lrb- right -rrb- wants to instil the same winning mentality that jose mourinho has at chelsea . if harry kane is to follow eriksen in succeeding in a second season , he will need some of the latter 's resistance to expectations . as a talented dane born to an ambitious father in laudrup country , pressure is something eriksen had to deal with from the start . that was vividly illustrated last october when , following a defeat for denmark against portugal , the national manager morten olsen hammered eriksen in the press . the gist was that eriksen , 22 then , ought to be controlling a game featuring cristiano ronaldo . ` he said it publicly and also told me personally , ' eriksen said . ` sometimes it helps , sometimes it does n't . i think it helped and it did n't hurt . i 've grown up with that . my dad was a coach for me when i was seven to 13 . he was a footballer as well , so he knew what he wanted . when i had a bad game , he would tell me to do better . ` there were times when i closed my door pretty hard after i spoke to him . and then the day after , it 's a new day . it 's football . i 've learned to live with pressure . in the danish newspapers the comparisons were with -lrb- michael -rrb- laudrup , so of course that started early . ' eriksen was publicly criticised by denmark coach morten olsen -lrb- right -rrb- for his performance against portugal . eriksen has been impressed by the breakthrough made by leading scorer harry kane -lrb- left -rrb- this season . andros townsend -lrb- right -rrb- celebrates scoring during tottenham 's 5-3 victory over chelsea in january . pressure is a fascinating topic at tottenham . mauricio pochettino has spoken frequently of the need to develop a winning mentality , given the team 's dreadful run of results against the bigger clubs . the test for kane will also come from maintaining what has been a sensational season . eriksen said : ` what harry 's doing is impressive . but again , you always have the pressure from outside . now if he does n't score he will feel it straight away . but harry is a worker as well . he works for the team . he is not a striker who waits for the ball . ' the challenge now is for tottenham 's two leading outfield forces to take on a fresher , stronger chelsea side . the 5-3 home win over mourinho 's side in january is still fresh in the mind . ` we showed that we can beat them , ' eriksen said . now eriksen must show chelsea what they might have won . * eriksen was speaking at a tottenham hotspur foundation event highlighting the education and football development centre programme , which provides academy-standard coaching alongside btec and fa level qualifications to create life-changing opportunities for young people aged 16-18 not in education , employment or training . visit tottenhamhotspur.com/foundation . kane and chelsea 's diego costa -lrb- left -rrb- will carry their team 's goal scoring expectations at wembley .	 tottenham face chelsea in the capital one cup final on sunday .   christian eriksen was rejected as a youngster while on trial with the blues .   denmark star has been impressed by harry kane 's breakthrough . 
23	mauricio pochettino will leave no room for sentiment when solving his goalkeeping dilemma for tottenham 's capital one cup final against chelsea . michael vorm has started all of tottenham 's games on their charge to wembley , but pochettino must balance that loyalty against the risks of leaving hugo lloris , one of the world 's finest goalkeepers , on the bench . pochettino promised that only cold judgement would be applied in his selection , which he claimed would not be known by the players until saturday or sunday morning before heading to the stadium . michael vorm has started all of tottenham hotspur 's capital one cup games on their charge to wembley . but the former swansea keeper may be dropped for the final against chelsea on sunday . he said : ` in each game and every game i take a decision and analyse which is the best side to pick . ` those who get left out need to be kept on board for the rest of the season though . the players know that only 18 players can be in the squad and only 11 can start . it 's not a different rule for the final . ` the players , like on the first day , need to understand that i am the boss . i decide the squad , i decide the starting xi and i decide who plays and who does not . tottenham manager maurico pochettino could opt to start his first-choice keeper hugo lloris instead . pochettino said the players had to understand that he was the manager and he picks the team . ` it is true that it is a final and an important game but the players need to accept my decision . ' pochettino 's selection in thursday 's europa league exit against fiorentina saw harry kane , kyle walker , danny rose and ryan mason left on the bench . all are understood to be in line to start against chelsea . pochettino , who was on espanyol 's bench for their 2006 copa del rey final win , added : ` when you are in football and you are a player , when you sign the contract it is for training , for your best in that and after you have to wait for the decision of the manager .

24	dan ashworth thinks harry kane will become an even better striker if he plays for england at the european under-21 championship this summer . two years ago kane was going through a miserable loan spell at norwich , but given his recent form , it would not be a surprise if he scored the winner for tottenham in the capital one cup final against chelsea on sunday . kane has scored 24 goals for spurs this term and is almost certain to earn his first senior england call-up in three weeks ' time . harry kane strikes a penalty against west ham , which led to his 14th premier league goal of the season . kane 's excellent form , including two goals against chelsea , makes it likely he will get an england call-up . this june england 's youngsters travel to the czech republic for the under-21 championships . seniors manager roy hodgson has told under-21 coach gareth southgate he can pick any eligible senior player and ashworth thinks kane would profit from the experience of playing in the youth tournament - even though he is likely to be a full international by then . ` it 's the best eight teams in europe , and it 's the next big international tournament to a senior one , ' said fa technical director ashworth . ` there are pressures , there are challenges of international football that ca n't always be replicated in club football and it 's the nearest thing he 's going to get to hopefully going on and winning something for england seniors as well . it would be immensely beneficial for him and any other player going . there are concerns about over-playing kane , who was rested for thursday 's europa league defeat . kane has already played 10 times for the under-21 side , and will be eligible for the european championships . kane has scored eight times for gareth southgate 's side , and dan ashworth wants him to stick with them . ` i 'm sure gareth would love to have him going with the 21s . ' kane has been a regular in southgate 's team since he took over from stuart pearce as young lions coach . pearce left his post after guiding the team through a dismal euros two years ago . england lost all three group stage matches and failed to score from open play . ashworth is optimistic about the team 's chances of success this time around though , thanks partly to kane 's form and that of saido berahino , who topped the scoring charts in qualifying with 10 goals in 10 appearances . the likes of raheem sterling -lrb- left -rrb- and alex oxlade-chamberlain are also eligible for the young lions . several senior players like luke shaw , ross barkley , raheem sterling , jack wilshere , alex oxlade-chamberlain , calum chambers and phil jones are also eligible for selection , but ashworth concedes southgate will have to take a pragmatic approach to squad selection . ` it 's our duty as a national association to try and get our best players and most appropriate players to go to every single tournament , ' said ashworth , who was west brom technical director before joining the football association . ` we want to win it . that 's important to me and it 's important to us . ` that 's not necessarily at the expense of ruining a relationship with a club or a player that 's played consecutively for three successive seasons and has never had a summer break . '	 harry kane has been in superb form for tottenham this season .   striker is likely to play for roy hodgson 's senior team next month .   but fa 's dan ashworth believes he should take part in youth tournament .   hodgson has said gareth southgate can pick any eligible players .   alex oxlade-chamberlain , phil jones and raheem sterling could all play .

26	tory cabinet minister sajid javid was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged that a huge bonus he received as a # 3 million-a-year city banker was channelled through a tax haven . mr javid , 45 , was promoted to culture secretary earlier this month from his berth as a treasury minister , where he was highly critical of city tax-avoidance schemes . but an investigation by the mail on sunday has established that when he was a high-flying executive at deutsche bank , mr javid was among a group of senior staff who were paid bonuses worth at least # 50,000 each through shares in a cayman islands company -- to lower the company 's total tax bill . bonus row : culture secretary sajid javid with his wife laura . accountants said the scheme would have allowed both the bank and its staff to make tax savings . bank insiders said the scheme was intended to benefit staff rather than the bank . mr javid , a protege of chancellor george osborne who has been tipped as a future tory leader , was promoted to the position of culture secretary following the resignation of maria miller over her expenses . during his 18-month tenure at the treasury , mr javid spearheaded the government 's drive to stamp out tax-dodging , declaring that the treasury was ` closing down all avenues for tax avoidance , whether it is companies or individuals ' . ` we have to be very strong on tax avoidance and britain is leading the way , ' he said . he joined deutsche in 2000 , rising to become managing director in 2004 , before relocating to singapore as its head of private equity business . he left the bank in 2009 during the global financial crisis , and won the safe tory seat of bromsgrove in the following year 's general election . under the plan , top bankers at deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid through a cayman islands company . around 300 staff returned an application form volunteering to take part . the scheme enabled staff to receive more of their bonuses than they would have done if paid in cash , court papers reveal . if a banker was due to receive a bonus of # 100,000 , after tax the amount received would fall to # 60,000 -- the remainder would have been paid as tax at 40 per cent tax . on top of that the bank would have to pay # 12,000 for national insurance contributions . under the deutsche scheme , the bank could put in # 100,000 , the banker would receive # 100,000 , and no ni payments were due . the system exploited a loophole in tax rules that meant if bankers were paid in special shares -- called ` restricted securities ' -- no tax was due . instead of taking all their bonus in cash , bankers were given the option to take part of it in shares in a cayman islands company called dark blue investments , set up by another investment bank , investec . the shares could not be sold for at least two months . when they were sold , bankers would have had to pay capital gains tax -- amounting to just 10 per cent if the shares were held for two years or more . but no other tax was payable by the individuals . bankers who volunteered for the scheme could take a maximum of 90 per cent of their total bonus in shares . some of the bonuses were worth over # 2 million . hmrc has not pursued any individuals in the case , but instead is demanding # 49 million from deutsche in income tax and ni it claims the bank should have paid on to the taxman . this month deutsche won the right to appeal against an initial decision in favour of hmrc . the bank said it was ` pleased ' with the appeal court 's decision but declined to comment further . top bankers at deutsche were approached in late 2003 asking if they wanted to have their bonuses paid in the form of ` restricted ' shares in a cayman islands-based company . javid was one of 300 who returned an application form volunteering to take part . according to the rules in place at the time , the shares attracted only a 10 per cent capital gains tax bill rather than income tax and national insurance contributions . at the height of his career at deutsche , mr javid was earning an estimated # 3 million a year , of which a substantial proportion was in the form of bonuses . he would have to have been paid a minimum of # 50,000 in bonuses in 2003 to take part in the cayman islands tax scheme . two years ago , a tax tribunal ruled that the ` carefully planned ' # 50 million scheme was invalid because deutsche effectively controlled the offshore firm , and ordered the bank to repay the money to her majesty 's revenue and customs . deutsche appealed against the ruling and the case is still going through the courts . last night , labour 's shadow treasury minister cathy jamieson said : ` sajid javid claimed when he was at the treasury to be very focused on tax avoidance . now we learn there are accusations that he himself signed up for a scheme whereby bonuses were paid through questionable arrangements whilst a senior banker at deutsche bank . ` the public facing a cost of living crisis wo n't take kindly to any double standards . ` sajid javid needs to make absolutely clear what he knew about this scheme , what his reasons for agreeing to be involved were and whether he himself or his employer profited from the arrangements in respect of his own bonuses . ' mr javid -- the son of a pakistani bus driver who grew up with his parents and four siblings in a two-bedroom flat , but who now lives with his wife laura and four children in a # 4 million home in fulham , west london -- is the first asian secretary of state . his electorally powerful rags-to-riches story , and his closeness to mr osborne , have combined to turn him into the fastest-rising political talent in the conservative party . a spokesman for mr javid said : ` this is a matter between deutsche bank and hmrc . sajid was paid with all tax deducted already . ` sajid did not personally receive any tax advantage whatsoever from these arrangements . '	 sajid javid received huge bonus when he worked as a city banker .   at least # 50,000 allegedly channelled through a tax haven by mp .   former treasury minister was recently promoted to culture secretary .   in his previous role mr javid was highly critical of tax-avoidance schemes .

' the source added that mr mcindoe had recently contacted all of those demanding their money back and promised to repay the cash . there are now fears the investments were made in a ponzi-style scheme , similar to the one run by us fraudster bernie madoff . in a ponzi scheme , money from new investors is simply redistributed to existing members , rather than being invested to generate returns . that means such schemes eventually collapse . a football agent , who represents a number of premiership players , said : ` some got into the scheme early and did very well and got their money back and the interest . ` there 's a player with # 1 million in that scheme , a player with # 500,000 , a player with # 300,000 , and there 's some with # 5,000 and # 10,000 . ` it 's nothing more than greed . i 've heard this guy has got to walk around with protection . people have been to scotland to find his family . ` the players ca n't go to the police . what player is going to stand up in court and say , `` excuse me , your honour , i 've just lost # 50,000 of my savings '' ? ` they 're going to look like idiots and the club could ask them what they 're doing . ' a financial expert who advises footballers said : ` we have known about it for a while and have kept our clients well away from it . ' born in the tough sighthill district of edinburgh , mr mcindoe spoke openly as a young player about his battle to overcome drink and gambling problems . nevertheless , he went on to enjoy a successful career , scoring 80 league and cup goals for ten clubs . sources say mr mcindoe was a charismatic and popular figure among other players . he left coventry last summer and retired to concentrate on his business career . fans reported seeing him driving his bentley around leamington spa , warwickshire , where he and a girlfriend shared an upmarket flat in a large townhouse . however , other residents told the mail on sunday mr mcindoe appeared to have left the property last year in a hurry . yesterday , mr mcindoe 's mother and brother declined to comment . mr mcindoe did not respond to messages left on his mobile .	 former wolverhampton wanderers player michael mcindoe ` approached potential investors on behalf of the scheme '   millionaire players ` promised 20 % - a-month return on their capital ' 
42	investigation : michael mcindoe , who is said to have recruited fellow football players into the investment venture he said was run by city financiers . as many as 100 footballers may have been taken in by an alleged investment fraud which fleeced them of a staggering total of # 30million , it is claimed today . the players , including former top-flight stars robbie keane and jimmy bullard , are said to have been lured in by promises of big returns before the scheme imploded under the weight of its debts . detectives are now probing alleged links to gambling on football matches , the sunday people reports . police told the paper they believe it 's the biggest swindle to ever hit british football . a source close to the investigation was quoted as saying : ` in all , footballers are thought to have handed over up to # 30million to those behind the scheme . ' the alleged scam was reported to the national fraud bureau last year and police are understood to be probing former footballer michael mcindoe , who is said to have recruited fellow players into the investment venture . the 35-year-old , who played midfield for coventry , wolves and scotland , went bankrupt in october , the sunday people says , with disclosed debts of # 3million - a figure the paper says experts described as ` the tip of the iceberg ' . ` the money lost has been astronomical , ' an unnamed source close to the case told reporters matthew drake and dan warburton . ` the # 3million mentioned in his insolvency papers is a very conservative figure . ` it could be up to # 15million once all the money is traced . ' mcindoe is alleged to have enticed his footballing peers into the scheme - said to have been run by city financiers - with promises of returns of up to 20 per cent on their investments . at least one line of investigation is that the failed fund may have in fact been a kind of ponzi scheme , a type of scam in which early investors ' returns are taken from the cash paid in by subsequent victims . such schemes always inevitably collapse , leaving all but the earliest investors out of pocket , but not before their operators are able to ride a gravy train of continual cash flow . news of the investigation follows the surprise appearance of former fulham midfielder jimmy bullard on reality television programme i 'm a celebrity get me out of here . at the time his place in the programme was revealed in november , reports claimed his appearance was down to monetary concerns that a thirst for publicity , after he lost # 625,000 on the investment scheme . bullard , who at the height of his earning power took home # 45,000 a week at hull , pocketed around # 100,000 for his appearance down under as he tried to recoup some cash sunk in the scheme . the 36-year-old reportedly told a friend he had ` been done out of a lot of money ' . ireland legend robbie keane , left , lost ' a fortune ' when the investment scheme collapsed . former fulham midfielder jimmy bullard went on a reality tv programme , right , to repair his finances after losing # 625,000 . ireland and spurs legend robbie keane , now of u.s. club la galaxy , was said to have lost ' a fortune ' . another player who asked not to be named , but who revealed he had played with mcindoe in the past , told the people he had lost # 100,000 . other alleged victims included players from lower league 's and one individual who invested # 60,000 inheritance bequeathed to him as a teenager . a metropolitan police spokesman said : ` an allegation of fraud was made to westminster cid in february . an investigation is ongoing . there has been no arrest . ' mcindoe proved difficult to track down . a call to the accountancy firm where several of his businesses were registered went unanswered . named after one of the most notorious conmen in us history , the ponzi scheme is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid selling . in its classic form , a ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a ` fail-safe ' business plan . investors join in their droves , lured by the huge returns on offer . but the fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes into the fund . eventually , all ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse under the weight of new money flooding in . the fraud was named after charles ponzi , an italian who emigrated to america in 1903 with $ 2.50 in his pocket . after a spell in prison for fraud , he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the price of postage stamps in italy and the u.s. . at the height of his success in 1920 , ponzi was making $ 250,000 a day - a mammoth sum for the era . when his scheme collapsed , ponzi pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison . investigators in the case of michael mcindoe 's failed investment programme are exploring the possibility it may have been a ponzi scheme .	 players said to have been lured in by promised returns of 20 per cent .   investigators believe it could be the biggest swindle ever to hit football .   former scotland player michael mcindoe said be part of the investigation .

44	well , it 's a start but it was not exactly a performance to strike fear into the hearts of the leading contenders for this world cup . for now england will be relieved to have finally got off the mark in this tournament here at the hagley oval and avoided the fierce opprobrium that defeat by scotland would have inevitably brought . yet deep down they will surely know that there will have to be a vast improvement on this 119-run victory if they are to ensure they get out of their group let alone become credible challengers for their first 50-over trophy . moeen ali salutes the crowd after his excellent century which gave england the platform to win . moeen took the game to the scots , playing aggressively while those around him floundered in christchurch . england will be relieved to have finally got off the mark at the 2015 cricket world cup at the hagley oval . moeen of england celebrates with his team-mates during the 119-run win over scotland in christchurch . moeen receives the player of the match award for his performance against the scots . on the face of it a score of 303 for eight followed by a bowling display that restricted the scots to 184 should represent a job fairly well done . it is just that , with the exception of an excellent all-round performance from moeen ali , too few england players could be satisfied with their contribution . specifically , england must look at how they let a score in excess of 350 slip out of their fingers when they were perfectly placed at 172 without loss from 30 overs to inflict carnage on their neighbours . moeen should be exempt from criticism . first he played with class and an improved shot selection to hit his second one-day international century and dominate england 's largest opening partnership in any world cup . then he again showed that he is a worthy first-choice spinner by taking two wickets , including the crucial one of kyle coetzer who had given the group a minnows a glimmer of hope with his 71 . other than that this was a display from england that betrayed the nerves and anxiety that are perhaps inevitable after the sheer scale of their defeats by two of the strongest teams in the tournament in australia and new zealand . too many batsmen appeared to be playing with a fear of failure when they had the perfect platform and opposition accommodating enough to have put on a show worthy of the aggressive intent they have vowed to produce . instead a tone was set by ian bell , who looked curiously out of touch after starting this tour in such vintage form that it appeared incredible he had been missing from the top of england 's one-day order for so long . here bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and was only rescued by the fluency and style displayed at the other end by moeen , who passed 50 for the first time in 12 one-day internationals and went on to hit five sixes in his 128 . for a while it seemed that moeen was destined to race past robin smith 's long-standing record england one-day score of 167 and had he done so then his team would surely have got close to 400 against a modest scotland attack . kyle coetzer led the fightback for scotland with an impressive 71 but they fell well short in the end . steven finn -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates taking a wicket in a much-improved bowling display against scotland . moeen should be exempt from criticism after his impressive showing for england against scotland . after starring with the bat moeen was also influential with the ball , finishing with two wickets for 47 . ian bell limped along to 54 from 85 balls and looked out of knick throughout on a good batting wicket . bell stumbles after being hit on the pads , and he never really got going , despite scoring a half-century . but once moeen fell inertia gripped england , not least when they could manage just 22 for the loss of two wickets in their batting powerplay . gary ballance , in particular , will worry england . he has done little to justify his last-minute inclusion at the expense of ravi bopara ahead of this world cup and looked rusty in falling for his third score of 10 in three matches . at least captain eoin morgan looked something like his old self as he hit 46 off 42 balls including two sixes of his own , only falling in a disappointing climax to the england innings along with jos buttler and chris woakes . the memory of ireland chasing down 328 against england in the last world cup was fresh enough to provide some apprehension in the break but the fact is scotland did not have sufficient quality in their batting to threaten . freddie coleman gets up high to pull the ball down but scotland 's batting never really got on top of the chase . joe root -lrb- right -rrb- celebrates removing scotland captain preston mommsen to end a dangerous partnership . scotland 's matt machan dives to stop the ball as scotland responded well to england 's big opening stand . scotland have never won a world cup game and for all their pre-match bombast aimed at turning up the heat on england it would be a surprise if they break their duck here , even against afghanistan . at least coetzer gave them respectability against an england attack who were relieved that they had no-one of the calibre of aaron finch or brendon mccullum to bowl at . not least steven finn , who was retained by england ahead of chris jordan and james tredwell despite being demolished for 49 off two overs in wellington , and repaid england 's faith with three wickets of his own . so england live to fight another day but will need to win their three remaining group games , starting with sri lanka back in wellington on sunday , to ensure their quarter-final place . for now at least they can sleep easily again . moeen celebrates scoring his century with team-mate bell during the 2015 cricket world cup match .	 england beat scotland by 119 runs to win world cup tie in christchurch .   moeen ali hits 128 in score of 303-8 and takes two wickets for 47 .   steven finn impressive with the ball but england 's batting lacks fluency .   ian bell looked curiously out of touch in an unconvincing win for england .

46	paris continues to be a source of joie de vivre for warren gatland as wales secured a fourth successive victory over france to keep alive their rbs 6 nations hopes . the local papers identified leigh halfpenny as ` la menace ' of the welsh team and the boy from gorseinon provided the kicks that proved the difference . gatland missed his side 's victory in the french capital two years ago but the kiwi travelled back across the channel with his side building momentum and still in for a late charge for the championship . leigh halfpenny was key for wales with his kicking , and he scored all six of their points in a tight first half before adding nine in the second . dan biggar -lrb- second right -rrb- is congratulated by scott baldwin after scoring the opening try for wales in the second half at the stade de france . the hosts started well with a crunching tackle on liam williams and a clinical turnover by eddy ben arous , but wales were undeterred . the visitors attacked the gain-line , with jamie roberts making hard yards off no 10 , and played through 11 phases before halfpenny was awarded a kickable penalty to open the scoring in the seventh minute . les bleus ' play had revolved around crash-ball merchant mathieu bastareaud but by naming the 19st 12lb centre on the bench , philippe saint-andre had signalled a wider and more open approach . it was a chance for remi lamerat , who has been identified by racing metro as a potential replacement for roberts , but he lasted just 18 minutes and , as camille lopez lined up a kick to level the scores , bastareaud was given a rousing reception by the sell-out crowd . wales knew that a powerful start would silence the parisian audience and a scuffed 25th-minute penalty by lopez was a let-off . assisted by a defence-splitting kick from davies , wales were able to clear their lines and move play into opposition territory . the scrum looked unconvincing on a churning pitch but , with the skills of toby faletau at the base , still provided a platform to attack . rather than crash through the middle , the ball went out wide to george north off first phase and france conceded a penalty at the subsequent breakdown . with his usual pinpoint accuracy , halfpenny took full advantage of the three points . it was advantage wales but , with bastereaud playing a key role in the french phases , they almost struck straight back . yoann huget finished clinically in the corner , but his score was chalked off for a forward pass . george north made his return after three weeks out with concussion and the game in paris marked his 50th cap for his country . wales ' rhys webb ducks out of a challenge from france 's yoann maestri as he attempts to break through during the first half . a

. damien chouly -lrb- left -rrb- and alun wyn jones -lrb- right -rrb- both win the ball at line-outs as the two countries exchanged blows at the stade de france . morgan parra struggles to find a way through against the amassed welsh defence as france chase the lead in paris on saturday evening . wales fly half biggar crosses the line for the opening try of the game to open up a lead after a cagey opening period of the game . france were unfortunate not to be level at half-time after lopez shanked another penalty just before the break . his half-back partner and club team-mate , morgan parra , takes the kicks for clermont but the scrum-half too was off target when he took over the duties . they attacked the welsh line through wesley fofana , but again left empty handed after play was called back for crossing . wales fell foul of the law soon after when alun-wyn jones failed to roll away from the tackle and france drew level with lopez 's kick . when france collapsed a driving maul , halfpenny was able to edge his team back in front with the kick . then north , becoming the youngest ever player to reach 50 caps , broke through the defence and rhys webb was allowed to snipe down the side of the breakdown . biggar scores after seeing off the close attentions of brice dulin to help keep wales ' championship hopes alive with a vital victory . biggar -lrb- second left -rrb- is congratulated by his team-mates as they head back to their half after his opening try on saturday evening . wales fans at the stade de france celebrate the try that helped bring them the victory in among the french supporters . the scrum-half found dan lydiate with his offload and dan biggar switched play to touch down in the corner on the stroke of the hour . halfpenny missed the conversion but he was on hand with a penalty shortly after to give his side an 11-point cushion . brice dulin crossed in the 67th minute but , despite a fine conversion from lopez , it was to be wales ' night as halfpenny kept the scoreboard ticking . north gets among the action as two frenchmen team up to take him down on a typically powerful run from the man on the right wing . jamie roberts -lrb- left -rrb- and rhy webb -lrb- right -rrb- both try to evade french tackles although the latter looks headed for the ground . france flanker bernard le roux tries to release the ball to a team-mate after being tackled as wales held firm to the french attacks . the welsh pack engage in a scrum as they held out for a victory to really bring themselves back on track in the championship . dulin goes over for a french try to close the gap and , despite a brilliant successful conversion , they could not quite catch wales . the welsh players celebrate victory at the full-time whistle in paris while the defeated french players look dejected with their defeat .	 george north made his return to the wales side on his 50th cap after three weeks out with concussion .   an edgy first half ended with wales in a 6-3 lead courtesy of the boot of leigh halfpenny with two penalties .   camille lopez levelled the scores with a second penalty for france early in the second half .   but halfpenny 's metronomic kicking continued as he made it 9-6 10 minutes into the second period in paris .   dan biggar went over in the corner for his first try for wales on the hour mark at the stade de france .   france 's brice dulin scored their first try against wales in six games after a five-match try drought .   halfpenny added six more points with the boot to give the welsh a cushion and they saw out the victory . 
47	as excitement builds around sunday 's final between chelsea and tottenham , sportsmail asked two fans to take part in a capital one cup final q&a . rory jennings from chelseafanschannel , and dan kilpatrick of the tottenham way answered questions from historic rivalry between the two clubs , previous results , as well as predictions for the wembley showdown . scroll down to read their answers . chelsea play tottenham in the capital one cup final at wembley on sunday hoping to get their own back . click here to check out rory jennings ' work on chelseafanschannel . click here to follow cfc on twitter . click here to check out dan kilpatrick 's work on the tottenham way . click here to follow ttw on twitter . feeling confident ? rj : extremely . after the catastrophe that was new year 's day we owe tottenham massively . combine that with the fact that they played in italy on thursday night in a huge match while we have had over a week off , and matic 's ban aside , we could n't really ask for much more going into the game . dk : yeah , weirdly i 'm very confident , perhaps because i ca n't bring myself to contemplate defeat . eden hazard -lrb- left -rrb- of chelsea and tottenham 's christian eriksen -lrb- right -rrb- will hope to inspire their team to a win . there 's plenty of history between the two teams -- what is it that make this rivalry intense ? rj : its very tricky to put a finger on exactly why the rivalry is so venomous . from their perspective i assume it 's the fact that they could n't beat us for years even when they had a superior team . or the fact that they have n't won a league match at stamford bridge for 25 years . or the fact that we knocked them out of the champions league by becoming the first london club to win it . for us i think its more to do with the hatred we receive from them . it 's responsive . dk : i hate arsenal for who they are but i hate chelsea for what they are -- a morally bankrupt , jammy , despicable club , with some of the most dislikable personnel in the game . the majority of their fans are in the same vein . our terrible record against them , plus the champions league fiasco , also contributes to the recent bad feeling but the rivalry dates back decades . tottenham fans generally do n't have fun at stamford bridge , and that may be a reason for the rivalry . stewards remove a fan from the pitch during an fa cup quarter-final replay at white hart lane . spurs were underdogs in the 2008 final but beat chelsea 2-1 , will lightning strike twice ? rj : the chelsea team of 2008 were not a team of winners . it had all the hallmarks of an avram grant team , who i believe has just taken his side to second in the africa cup of nations . under grant we came out second best in the carling cup , second in the premier league and second in the champions league . and we were knocked out of the fa cup by barnsley . you say they were underdogs but i do n't think too many chelsea fans were surprised that grant managed to steer us to defeat that day . dk : yeah , we 'd love a 2-1 this season , and i think we 're more closely matched now than then . jubilant tottenham player after beating chelsea to lift the carling cup in 2008 . what are your memories of that day ? rj : the overriding memory of the day is the pain and torture as woodgate got to the ball ahead of cech right in front of us . and then being soaking wet at wembley listening to endless renditions of ` oh when the spurs ' ... it was agony but it tottenham deserved it . they were excellent . it takes huge character to come back from a goal down in a cup final . dk : i had a ticket but in the corporate seats at wembley . there were more chelsea fans and neutrals around me than spurs fans but it was stunning looking across at the spurs end and the noise was incredible . i ca n't remember much of the game but berbatov 's cool penalty obviously stands out and i went crazy when woodgate scored . a couple of the chelsea fans shook my hand at the final whistle , which was a touch . · . jonathan woodgate nods home the winner - getting to the ball before goalkeeper petr cech . dimitar berbatov netted a cool penalty during the 2-1 victory at wembley stadium . which of your players will make the difference this time around ? rj : i think the only bright spot when tottenham destroyed us on new years day was the performance of eden hazard . he seemed to really understand the rivalry and how desperate chelsea fans were to get something from the game . if he plays to a similar level and those around him raise their game , i think that he could be too much for spurs to deal with . dk : kane and eriksen are the obvious ones but i 've got a good feeling about lamela too . harry kane will be looking to make the difference against chelsea at wembley this weekend . that 5-3 game is still fresh in the memory -- how will that affect this game ? rj : i think it will affect the game positively for everybody . it will definitely inspire tottenham , they scored five goals against us . however , i also think it will inspire chelsea . there is n't a better way to get back at a team to whom you feel you owe one , by beating them at a final at wembley . dk : on the one hand , it will give spurs belief they can outplay and beat chelsea , which is crucial . on the other , it will make the chelsea players -lrb- who must be prioritising the premier league and champions league -rrb- extra motivated to exact revenge . so , it could be beneficial for both teams . chelsea players look dejected after losing 5-3 to tottenham at white hart lane on new year 's day . and what of nemanja matic 's ban ?

50	that was n't in the script : penalties , the ataturk stadium and a momentous anniversary looming -- surely the only outcome could have been a liverpool win ? not this time . here was a european first , liverpool failing in a shootout , and that it happened at the scene of their greatest triumph thickened the plot . going out of the europa league at the hands of besiktas was not how they aimed to mark 10 years since winning the champions league . inevitably , it went to the wire and it took place at the same end at which they outwitted milan in the 2005 champions league final . but when tolgay arslan thumped home besiktas ' fifth successful penalty , dejan lovren wilted and sent his kick high and wide . dejan lovren missed the 10th penalty as liverpool crashed out of the europa

istanbul . lovren looks gutted as besiktas celebrate after he missed the final penalty of the shootout to see liverpool lose 5-4 from the spot . liverpool manager brendan rodgers consoles his players after lovren was the unlucky man to miss from the penalty spot . ` unfortunately , on this occasion , istanbul is not a happy place , ' conceded a crestfallen brendan rodgers . with better finishing , it might have been . liverpool had opportunities to build on the lead mario balotelli had given them at anfield last week but lacked a killer instinct and it was their misfortune to run into a side , high on energy and fervour , that wanted to create history . it was never going to be a quiet night . with ticket prices reduced to attract a big crowd , the atmosphere had been building all day . thousands of home fans congregated at the site where their regular stadium is being redeveloped , and come 8pm local time , they were ready to play their part . yet as loud as the turks made themselves , liverpool 's players never flinched . besiktas had admirable endeavour but no star quality and it became apparent early on that mistakes -- or a stroke of genius -- would be the visitors ' biggest foe . liverpool 's mario balotelli accuses besiktas 's necip uysal of going down easy after a push by the premier league striker . balotelli yells at uysal on thursday evening during their

would not have put any money on liverpool holding their nerve but they have turned things around impressively and with the defence working smoothly it became a question of whether they could score to kill the tie . they had enough chances to do so before the break as balotelli and daniel sturridge -- a pairing rodgers had started with only once before -- began causing problems for besiktas with power and running . balotelli was in the thick of the action straight away , jostling with necip uysal and picking up a booking for a lunge at veli kavlak , but this was n't an erratic display and the deft pass he produced to send sturridge through should have produced the first goal on 33 minutes . alberto moreno and raheem sterling had both gone close but neither had the time and space sturridge was afforded when balotelli ushered him through . much to rodgers ' frustration , however , he wanted to take the shot with his left foot and that allowed besiktas to scramble the danger away . sturridge was involved again moments later , this time exchanging passes with moreno on the edge of the area , but the wing back succeeded only in shooting straight at cenk gonen , who comfortably clung on to the drive . besiktas offered little in response . for all that slaven bilic hopped around his technical area , frantically trying to provide some inspiration , the closest they came to finding a breakthrough before half-time was a tame effort from olcay sahan that simon mignolet easily gathered . everything , it seemed , was going to plan for liverpool and the game followed a similar pattern when they emerged after the interval . though the onus was on besiktas to be creative and clever , all they offered were speculative attempts from serdar kurtulus and jose sosa . but there was one key difference . liverpool 's intensity as an attacking force dwindled and , gradually , they started dropping deeper and deeper . bilic , who was like a coiled spring , sensed there might be an opening and he made a change , sending on arslan for the tiring sosa . how it paid off . within 12 minutes of his introduction , arslan dramatically changed the balance of the tie , dispatching a glorious left-foot drive beyond mignolet after gokhan tore and demba ba created an opening for him 20 yards out . the stadium erupted as it curled inside the post . there is no question it stunned liverpool . they looked groggy and were almost knocked out cold in injury time when ba smashed a shot against the woodwork from eight yards , the chance coming after arslan slalomed beyond three challenges to win a corner . tolgay arslan -lrb- right -rrb- scores the goal that put besiktas 1-0 up on the night after demba ba -lrb- second from right -rrb- provided the assist . besiktas 's tolgay arslan -lrb- right -rrb- runs away in celebration after scoring the opening goal of the europa league round of 32 second leg tie . besiktas took the lead in the 72nd minute through arslan as

's olcay sahan -lrb- left -rrb- and his team-mates celebrate their goal against liverpool on thursday night in istanbul . besiktas goalkeeper cenk gonen celebrates after his team scored during the europa league round of 32 second leg match . liverpool went 1-0 down against besiktas in the second leg as the game went to extra time in the europa league tie . it was only the third penalty shootout defeat in liverpool 's history -- they also lost to northampton town in 2010 and wimbledon in 1993 . extra-time at least enabled rodgers to work on his squad but that did not halt the shift in momentum . liverpool looked spent up front and the first 15 minutes became a test of endurance . mignolet , in particular , excelled , standing firm when besiktas threatened . a figure of derision not so long ago , he was comfortably liverpool 's top performer and it became inevitable , as besiktas started to run out of ideas , that the belgian would become the main character in the final reckoning . ultimately , he could n't reprise jerzy dudek 's role and , for this season , the european adventure has no happy ending . the task now is to make sure they have europe to look forward to next year . all these years after the turkish fans welcomed english clubs to hell , and they still put on quite of a show for their visitors . thousands had massed inside the ataturk fully two hours before kick-off and a cacophony of boos and whistles greeted the liverpool players when they emerged in their tracksuits to sample the atmosphere 90 minutes before the start . liverpool landed back on merseyside in the early hours of friday morning confident of escaping any punishment from uefa over financial fair play regulations . the club have made substantial losses in the last two years , but it is understood that uefa accept the next financial figures will show a small profit and that liverpool are on course to make an even bigger one the following year . besiktas issued an apology to liverpool fans after some were left stranded in the centre of istanbul , 90 minutes ' drive from the stadium , when their pre-arranged transport failed to turn up . liverpool complained to the turkish club and issued a statement saying : ` besiktas have responded by offering a full apology to those supporters affected by the disruption . ' after finishing last week 's first leg at anfield in controversial circumstances by taking the ball off captain jordan henderson to score a penalty , mario balotelli was soon at it again on thursday night . the striker had already had a ticking-off from referee damir skomina before he became the first name in the slovenian official 's book for ploughing into veli kavlak . raheem sterling shoots for liverpool during the europa league tie in the first half in istanbul on thursday evening . daniel sturridge forces a save out of besiktas goalkeeper cenk gonen as liverpool look to take the lead during the last 32 tie . balotelli was substituted for adam lallana after 82 minutes and the striker gives manager brendan rodgers a glance as he leaves the pitch . besiktas supporters pictured during the europa league tie as one sign in istanbul reads : ` welcome to hell ' besiktas fans cheer on their team during the europa league round of 32 match on thursday night in istanbul . andriy shevchenko watches his penalty saved by liverpool goalkeeper jerzy dudek in the champions league final in istanbul in 2005 . liverpool celebrate winning the champions league on penalties on may 25 , 2005 , in istanbul as they beat ac milan . steven gerrard , absent on thursday night , holds the champions league trophy up in 2005 after winning on penalties in istanbul .	 mario balotelli received a yellow card for persistent fouling after just 11 minutes .   balotelli and daniel sturridge were paired up front while jordon ibe also started .   besiktas substitute tolgay arslan scored after 72 minutes via a demba ba assist .   ba could have scored the winner in the 92nd minute when he hit the crossbar from six yards out .   sturridge limped off after 106 minutes as he was replaced by striker rickie lambert .   the game went to extra time but neither side could score and it went to penalties .   liverpool beat ac milan 3-2 on penalties in the 2005 champions league final in istanbul .   liverpool lost 5-4 on penalties against besiktas as dejan lovren missed the 10th and final penalty .

58	manchester united 's new kit contract has led to serious repercussions for andy murray , the england cricket team and rugby 's british and irish lions . all three have lost backing from adidas because of their # 750million investment in supplying united shirts from next season . adidas were not prepared to renew their shirt agreement with murray because of the increased cost , while the england cricket partnership has been greatly downgraded and might end early . and the german company have announced they will be ending their 18-year association with the lions -- despite replica shirts selling so well . manchester united 's adidas deal will begin next season , ending their association with nike . andy murray has already had his ties to adidas cut - the scot is now with american firm under armour . the massive price of winning the united deal from arch-rivals nike has meant adidas have had to re-evaluate the importance of other properties , with their funding focused on the core activities of football , fitness and running . american firm under armour , with whom murray signed when adidas did not meet his numbers , are also favourites to take over the lions contract for the next tour to new zealand in 2017 . the millennium stadium has always put on the best pre-match show in the six nations . but their impressive laser display last friday night can not be emulated by england rugby 2015 as it will be only dusk when the world cup opening ceremony finishes at twickenham around 7.30 pm on september 18 . instead they will utilise the pitch itself in way that does n't jeopardize the playing surface when england take on fiji half-an-hour later . the atmosphere at the millennium stadium was crackling with the pre-match pyrotechnics before the match . you ca n't get away with anything on social media , even if a tweet is more than two years old . a screen grab of foul-mouthed bbc rugby co-commentator brain moore 's response from january 2013 -- after being told by an astute armchair rugby viewer that he turns the sound off because of moore -- was retweeted hundreds of times during england 's win in cardiff on friday . the loveable moore -lrb- above -rrb- wrote : ` use the red button for the alternative commentary , you thick t *** .

60	at selhurst park last saturday , when chelsea were playing crystal palace , an act of supreme sportsmanship passed almost unnoticed . not quite in the same league as paolo di canio when he caught the ball inside the everton penalty area at goodison park after paul gerrard dislocated his knee in december 2000 . or uefa giving robbie fowler a fair play award after he pleaded with referee gerald ashby not to award a penalty to liverpool when he went down under a challenge from arsenal keeper david seaman in 1997 . jose mourinho -lrb- right -rrb- shaking hands with crystal palace manager neil warnock on saturday . mourinho celebrates chelsea 's victory after a match during which he showed his more generous side . a smiling mourinho speaks during the pre-match press conference before chelsea faced maribor . still , jose mourinho 's generosity should be highlighted , particularly after a weekend of football that finished with swansea manager garry monk accusing stoke winger victor moses of cheating . mourinho 's rampant chelsea team were 2-0 up passing the ball for fun as palace willed it to go out of play for them to make a substitution . at the time , with chelsea in complete control after goals from oscar and cesc fabregas , it felt like palace manager neil warnock would be made to wait for ever . both teams were already down to 10 . chelsea defender cesar azpilicueta was sent off for a studs-up challenge on mile jedinak and palace defender damien delaney was sent off for a second booking before half-time . with 21 minutes left , warnock 's team were temporarily reduced to nine when james mcarthur was forced off the field with an ankle injury . it was then that mourinho approached warnock in the technical area . mourinho passed a message to fabregas , the closest chelsea player to the technical area and his team suddenly eased off . palace were finally able to get the ball out of play . warnock made the substitution , bringing on adlene guedioura to replace mcarthur to even the teams up , numerically at least . to mourinho 's credit he then instructed oscar , who received the ball from chelsea 's throw-in , to kick the ball back to palace keeper julian speroni . the brazilian obliged . it was a magnificent sporting gesture . there are times when it is easy to bury mourinho for his touchline posturing , but he has been on his best behaviour of late . against arsenal on october 5 , he had very little involvement in the incident which led to arsene wenger shoving him in the chest during their 2-0 defeat . there was the usual mischief in the air last friday when he reacted to news that wenger had got off scott-free after the incident at stamford bridge . ` me ? me ? me ? ' he joked . ` stadium ban ' . he has taken to answering tricky situations by lacing them with sarcasm to avoid appearances on the back pages for all the wrong reasons . mourinho is usually far more gracious when his team are winning and he is has certainly been in a better mood of late . arsene wenger and mourinho during their infamous touchline spat in chelsea 's win over arsenal . ahead of the game at palace , which they eventually won 2-1 , chelsea 's manager claimed he is ` a humble guy who tries to learn every day ' . he was referring to roy keane 's criticism of mourinho after he attempted to shake hands with paul lambert when his team were beating aston villa 3-0 on september 27 . he is no angel on the touchline , we know that . last season he provoked manchester city manager manuel pellegrini when he jumped into the stands to celebrate with his son jose jnr after fernando torres ' last-minute winner . he has since apologised for jabbing former barcelona coach tito vilanova , sadly no longer with us , in the eye during a highly-charged super cup tie with real madrid in 2011 . he has cleaned up his act on the touchline , something he has spoken about since his return to english football with chelsea . paolo di canio holds the ball after catching it so paul gerrard -lrb- centre , on floor -rrb- can receive treatment in 2000 . robbie fowler -lrb- right -rrb- and david seaman look perplexed after the award of a penalty in 1997 . last march he said : ` in this country , it 's easier to behave because almost everybody behaves and the fourth officials are there to help , not create more problems . ` normally they 're there to speak and have a dialogue , telling you to calm down , that you do n't need to do that , must n't make it difficult for the referee . i know i have that responsibility to show maturity . ` i know i have normally a better emotional control than one year ago , two years ago , five years ago . i know experience helps . ' he was on the edge of the technical area for all the right reasons on saturday when he he spoke with warnock about making the change to make it ten versus ten again . would he have made the same gesture if chelsea were n't in complete control , ` from minute one to minute 94 ' , as mourinho remarked after the game ? actually , let 's not go there .	 jose mourinho made chelsea put ball out when crystal palace were a man down at selhurst park on saturday .   it was a magnificent sporting gesture from the chelsea manager .   mourinho has been on his best behaviour on the touchline of late .   arsene wenger was the aggressor during battle of stamford bridge . 
61	it was after jos buttler 's incendiary 121 off 74 balls in the lord 's one-day international against sri lanka in may that alastair cook announced his limited-overs wicketkeeper was ` not ready ' for test cricket . self-effacingly , buttler agreed . but after more mishaps with the gloves yesterday from matt prior , attitudes might have changed . the 32-year-old prior is a warhorse of 78 tests , well-liked by colleagues and with a proud record as a counter-attacking no 7 . under pressure : doubts have been cast on matt prior 's position as england 's no 1 wicketkeeper after a number of missed catches in the first test with india at trent bridge . beaten : a shot from india 's cheteshwar pujara finds its way past the dive of prior on day four of the first test at trent bridge . the competition : there have been calls for jos buttler -lrb- left -rrb- , england 's short form wicketkeeper , to replace prior in the team . after being dropped for the last two tests of the australian debacle , he was recalled against sri lanka at lord 's and responded with a punchy 86 . named england 's cricketer of the year in may 2013 , prior had apparently refound his zest . since then , though , things have threatened to unravel . it 's hard to be over-critical of his batting : he alone held on during england 's first-innings collapse against sri lanka at headingley , and on friday here in nottingham he fell victim to a dismal piece of umpiring from kumar dharmasena . but his glovework is another matter . the alarm bells began to ring at headingley , where prior dropped kumar sangakkara on 27 shortly after lunch on a chaotic first day . the catch was so straightforward that liam plunkett was halfway through a celebratory leap when prior allowed the ball , which he did n't realise had been pinned to his chest by his gloves , to plop to earth . disappointed : prior could only make five runs in england 's innings , which was rescued by an unlikely last wicket stand between joe root and james anderson . appealed : india wicketkeeper mahendra singh dhoni successfully pleads the wicket of prior off the bowling of bhuvneshwar kumar . heroic : james anderson set a world record on saturday as he and joe root formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue england on the fourth day of the first test with india at trent bridge in nottingham . if there was a touch of misfortune about that , then his wicketkeeping in this test has done little to quell fears the achilles trouble which limited him to one early-season championship match for sussex is not evidence of irreversible wear and tear . even ahead of this game , buttler was called up as cover because prior was experiencing tightness in his right thigh . prior allayed fears with a smart catch to his left to see off india opener shikhar dhawan on wednesday morning , but has since missed three chances low to his right : ms dhoni was dropped on 50 on the second morning , and on saturday afternoon he twice failed to lay a glove on chances offered by murali vijay . whether buttler would have snaffled them may no longer be the point . he is 23 , full of drive and invention , and is averaging 40 for struggling lancashire . he is just the sort of cricketer , in other words , who might fit neatly into the template of a brave new era .	 prior 's glovework is becoming a cause for concern , with several missed chances against india .   his batting remains beyond reproach , though he only made five in england 's innings at trent bridge .   jos buttler , england one-day wicketkeeper , is waiting for his test chance . 
62	click here to read sam peters ' full match report from twickenham . that was a very impressive performance from george ford at fly-half in his first england start and he has to ` go again ' against australia next week , a game england must win . and he must play again with owen farrell who was n't quite so impressive individually but this combination must be given time to grow . my only big regret from saturday is that england took farrell off midway through the second half . that did n't make a lot of sense , they need as much game time together as possible . george ford -lrb- centre -rrb- impressed on his full international debut in england 's 28-9 defeat of samoa . ford played at fly-half - moving his childhood friend owen farrell -lrb- right -rrb- in to the centre . ford impressed me in many ways . physically he immediately proved he was up to it by taking two or three big hits from the samoans , who will undoubtedly have targeted him and would look to have tested him out physically as soon as possible . there were a couple of nice touch finders and he did very well indeed for england 's first try running a wrap around with farrell and then finding mike brown with a good pass to create the opportunity for jonny may to show his pace and score by the posts . again there was an electric break on the half hour which probably should have resulted in a second england try but he possibly overcooked the pass a little and mike brown could n't cling on . then in the second half he produced a moment of sumptuous class with his cross-field kick to anthony watson to create mike brown 's try . england 's only error of judgement was to remove farrell midway through the second half . ford combined well with farrell by running a wrap around that led to england 's first try . jonny may dives over the line to score his second try and end england 's losing run . his goal kicking was very steady , my one constructive criticism is that given the conditions and his excellent kicking game -- and indeed that of farrell -- england tried to play too much rugby too early in the first half . england should have been ` playing ' 20-30 yards further down the pitch . make that kicking expertise count territorially before you start ` playing ' . he was honest enough to admit his fault afterwards , now he must show the confidence to change on the hoof in the heat of battle . with farrell , my only real concern is that given his physicality -- he loves to get involved -- he is probably joining too many mauls and rucks . the big advantage of playing two footballers and playmakers in the side is that you always have the two options available . anthony watson -lrb- centre -rrb- breaks through ahead of passing to mike brown for england 's second try . england coach stuart lancaster has several selection decisions to make ahead of the south africa clash . you do n't want one of the players tied up needlessly in the heavy forward exchanges no matter how physically able he might be . for australia , i would bring dylan hartley back at hooker and , although it 's a bit unfair on brad barritt , i would go with luther burrell at outside centre . you need that extra pace outside farrell . i also enjoyed a lot of what anthony watson did , he must go again and get more game time in huge matches . i would also bring danny cipriani on to the bench . if the big decision had been made to go with ford/farrell england need a like for like replacement at 10 if ford gets injured . mike brown 's second-half try . george ford 's cross-field kick was a beauty , drilled hard and low to keep the hang time to a minimum so that defenders did n't have a chance to organise themselves . anthony watson did very well to latch on to the ball and even better to resist the temptation to go for glory in just his second start for england and score a try in front of 82,000 fans at twickenham . watson scoring was 50-50 at best but he capped an impressive performance by showing the maturity to pass to mike brown , who was in a better position to make scoring a certainty . it was very classy and professional . it was also an important moment for brown , who will have enjoyed getting back on the scoreboard .	 england defeated samoa 28-9 in their qbe autumn international .   george ford impressed on his full international debut at twickenham .   ford must concentrate on building a partnership with owen farrell ahead of the next test against south africa .

69	` bullfighting is not a sport . it was never supposed to be . it is a tragedy ... the tragedy is the death of the bull . ' so wrote ernest hemingway after he witnessed his first bullfight as a reporter in spain . but three bulls yesterday turned the tables on their killers . they challenged their own ritual slaughter - and won . olé ! david mora is floored by an el ventorrillo fighting bull during a bullfight at las ventas bullring in madrid . beast versus man : the matador is tossed backwards by the huge bull , which is primed for the kill . floored : mora was downed by his first bull , before he was even able to plant any banderillos into its body . head over heels : mora is flicked around the bullring like a ragdoll by the enraged bull he intended to kill . gored : mora was pierced through his femoral artery by the bull , and needed immediate emergency surgery . the goring is seen here from another angle . mora was still in intensive care today but was said to be recovering . disaster : mora 's fellow matadors run to his aide , capes flapping , as he is repeatedly gored by the raging bull . occupational hazard : assistants help a grimacing mora from the bullring after he was badly wounded in the fight yesterday . a right bulls up : the injured matador is carried away as his blood drips down the elaborate outfit of one of his assistants . bulls 3 - matadors 0 . if bullfights had a score line that would have been the one at the las ventas ring in madrid , spain , on tuesday evening . all three matadors were gored , one of them severely , and the rest of the bloody spectacle was cancelled because there was nobody left standing to fight . it happened at the 12th corrida in the spanish capital , less than half-way through the fiesta of san isidro , the biggest single event in the official season . described by hemingway as the ` world series of bullfighting ' , it lasts for nearly a month with a fight every day . antonio nazare is gored in his leg by a los chospes ranch fighting bull after killing the one that took out mora . nazare falls to the ground bleeding after his clash with the bull . fighting bulls usually weigh about half a ton . tragedy : nazare 's cape drops to reveal the bull 's bloodied back , as it makes sure he is unable to get back up . death in the afternoon : the bull which beat nazare spews blood after it is killed by jimenez fortes , top second left , in the traditional manner - but without the flair and flamboyance which bullfight audiences come for . victory : fortes salutes the spectators as the los chospes ranch fighting bull dies at his feet . first to lose was david mora . brought . down by his first bull of the afternoon , he was gored in three places as . he was tossed around the ring like a rag doll . after . mora was carried-off and rushed to the infirmary for emergency surgery , . antonio nazare followed tradition and dispatched the bull using cape . and sword . but he did so as swiftly as possible , with none of the flair audiences expect . then . it was nazare 's turn to fight his own first bull of the afternoon . within minutes he followed mora to the infirmary with a single goring . flair : after dispatching nazare 's beast , fortes swings his cape as he fights his own bull . ouch : but he was soon also stuck beneath the merciless charge of the bull he had intended to kill . fortes 's sword flies from his hand as the bull does its best to survive the mortal combat it has been forced into . the bullfighter is tossed into the air by a flick of the bull 's neck , as both are stained red with blood . there was little the matador could do on the day to fight back against the half-tonne of pure muscle and rage he was matched up against . not getting up : with no one left to fight the remaining bulls , there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida - the first time in 35 years that a bullfight has been stopped during the fiesta de san isidro . the one remaining matador , jimenez fortes , stepped into the ring and killed the animal , again swiftly and without flamboyance . then his own first bull sent him flying through the air , catching him on its horns three times . after fortes was taken to the infirmary the bull was enticed back into its stall alongside the pens of the other three who had also escaped their scheduled deaths in the afternoon . with no one left to fight them , there was no alternative than to cancel the rest of the corrida . it was the first time that had happened during san isidro since 1979 , and only the third time in the fiesta 's history .	 three matadors lost to bulls in the 12th corrida of the fiesta de san isidro .   madrid festival was dubbed ` the world series of bullfighting ' by hemingway .   one required emergency surgery , the others were less badly hurt . 
70	america 's soccer team has a must-watch world cup match against germany kicking off at noon -lrb- est -rrb- on thursday and coach jurgen klinsmann has given everyone permission to take the day off . the usa coach sent out an absence note on wednesday via social media for supporters - with understanding bosses - to excuse them for the day , and reminded those willing not to forget to ` wear your jersey ' . the best excuse for staying at home , klinsmann believes , is because the team ` will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round ' . video scroll down to watch usa prepare for germany clash ... by playing football tennis . you 're excused : manager jurgen klinsmann had given team usa supporters permission to skip work . good excuse : usa have progressed to the last 16 despite losing against klinsmann 's native germany . the note , tweeted by the official @ussoccer account , reads : ` please excuse -lrb- insert name here -rrb- from work on thursday , june 26th . ' i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace , but i can assure you that it is for an important cause . ` the #usmnt has a critical world cup game vs. germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round . ` by the way , you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well . go usa ! ' when jermaine jones stands for the national anthems of his countries on thursday , he will soak in the moment . jones , like four american teammates and his coach , will be familiar with both the star-spangled banner and the deutschlandlied before the united states ' world cup game against germany . after playing three games in 2008 for the nation in which he grew up , jones switched allegiance to the u.s. two years later . ` when i hear the anthem from the united states , i will close my eyes and let everything go through , ' the tenacious midfielder said . and then comes the big game . four years of work by the u.s. come down to 90 or so minutes in the afternoon heat and possibly rain at arena pernambuco on the outskirts of a sprawling beach city known as the brazilian venice . now you see stars ! the back page of german daily bild anticipates klinsmann and his usa team will be handed a beating against germany . having squandered the chance to clinch advancement earlier this week against portugal by allowing a stoppage-time goal in a 2-2 draw , the americans might need at least a tie against the three-time champions to reach the knockout stage of consecutive world cup for the first time . the story lines are gripping : . mission : klinsmann in training with his usa squad ahead of their group g showdown for top spot . the germans beat portugal 4-0 and tied ghana 2-2 , leaving them with four points and a plus-four goal difference . the americans , who defeated ghana 2-1 , have four points and a plus-one goal difference . ghana and portugal , with one point each , play simultaneously in brasilia , knowing a tie in either game would eliminate both of them . u.s. soccer federation officials will have a system to relay the score of the other match to the bench . ` to be able to keep that level of interest for another four , five , six and hopefully more days would be great for the sport , ' ussf president sunil gulati said . ' i think for the first time in our history - recent history , i 'm not going to talk about 1950 or before - our players believe they 're capable of beating anyone . ' he rejects the notion the dual nationals are any less american than those who came up through the u.s. youth system . preparation : usa can top the group but have to beat germany to do so due to their superior goal difference . when the u.s. and germany met for the first time in the group stage of the 1998 cup , klinsmann scored the second goal in a 2-0 win . the teams played four years later in the quarterfinals , when michael ballack 's 39th-minute goal gave the germans a 1-0 victory . the americans still complain scottish referee hugh dallas declined to call a penalty kick when gregg berhalter 's 49th-minute shot hit the left arm of defender torsten frings at the goal line . while the germans have four off days between matches , the u.s. has only three . and teams are 0-4 after games in the steamy amazon rainforest capital of manaus , where the americans played sunday night . ` it 's the biggest game of all of our lives , ' beckerman said . ` any fatigue in our legs will be erased . we 've got to give it everything we 've got and more . ' all but through : usa know a draw would be enough to see them through for definite . there is an outside chance the u.s. and portugal could tie for second with four points and be even on all tiebreakers - for instance , if the americans lose 3-0 and the portuguese win 2-0 . in that case , a drawing of lots would decide which team advances . the teams that move on will have second-round matchups with belgium , russia , south korea or algeria . gulati hopes for more , much more , that will help boost the growing american fan base . ` it 's pretty easy to get emotional about , ' he said , ` wanting to see this day happen . it 's not the day . that day is still to come . and that day has got a trophy involved . '	 us soccer coach jurgen klinsmann has sent out absence note via twitter and reminded supporters to ` wear your jersey '   usa play germany in a must-watch 2014 world cup match at noon -lrb- est -rrb- on thursday .   note jokingly says usa ` will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round '   a draw would see both teams progress to the last sixteen of the tournament , although both sides say they will be going for a win .   klinsmann facing the nation he helped win the 1990 world cup title and coached to the 2006 semifinals .   u.s. coach jurgen klinsmann facing the nation he helped win the 1990 world cup title and coached to the 2006 semifinals .   germany coach joachim loew managing against klinsmann , his former boss .   five german-american players with u.s. servicemen fathers and german mothers going up against a german squad filled with familiar faces from the bundesliga .   fear by some the u.s. and germany might collude on a draw , which would advance both nations while eliminating portugal and ghana . both sides insist that wo n't happen .   thousands of american fans with red , white and blue gear making the trek to the southern hemisphere to cheer in person and millions back home tuning into games at record levels .   ` the country is in a soccer fever and they 're glued to the tvs when we play , ' midfielder kyle beckerman said on wednesday .

or lexi as she called her - as a babysitter for their two daughters in the spring of 2011 . the two faces of evil : eric millerberg recklessly injected rasmussen with lethal doses of heroin and methamphetamine during a night of sex and drugs . when she died , he dumped her body in a trash bag . left , he is pictured when he is arrested and right , after cleaning up for trial . they became friends and started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with the teen before alexis began requesting that they try harder drugs like methamphetamine and heroin . eventually they began paying alexis with meth . according to salt lake tribune , dea testified that on the night of the girl 's death , she had picked up alexis to baby sit her kids . she said as soon as alexis arrived at the house , eric millerberg helped her get high by injecting her with drugs -

73	the poet 's tale : chaucer and the year that made the canterbury tales . by paul strohm . -lrb- profile books # 15.99 -rrb- . perhaps it is because contemporary life is intolerable that people are flocking back to the past . they really ca n't get enough of it , as the obsession with hilary mantel and tudor politics demonstrates -- though in my view , mark rylance and damian lewis are n't a patch on kenneth williams and sid james in carry on henry , which covered the same ground as wolf hall and more amusingly , too . ` has she been chaste ? ' -- ` all over normandy ' , etc. . when at last 16-century history begins to pall -- those lutes and galliards in a renaissance court ; the king 's matrimonial wrangles and the breach with the papacy -- my bet is we 'll crank backwards another couple of hundred years and become fascinated with all things medieval . the son of a wine merchant , chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the thames . in anticipation of the next trend , paul strohm has written a pungent book about the ` turbulence and change ' of the middle ages , when latin and norman french were mixing and merging to create the modern english language and hence the modern english identity . it was a picturesque period -- the tournaments and festivities , ` jousting and lance-play ' , the ` lavish consumption and frivolous display ' : edward iii spent millions on ribbons and taffeta embroidered with jewels . the fashion was for extravagant hats and ` outlandish coiffures ' , which make alexander mcqueen look like the salvation army . money came from the wool trade , ` the nation 's most important income source ' . the poet geoffrey chaucer worked as a controller in the wool customs and excise department , his job being to keep the accounts and collect tariffs and duties . the son of a wine merchant , chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the thames . he began his career in aristocratic service as ` a genteel and versatile kind of errand runner ' , known as a valet or esquire , before being promoted , as a ` literate ' civil servant , to ` the administrative bureaucracy of later medieval england ' . an unpromising background for an artist , you might think . but then , t. s. eliot worked in a bank and philip larkin was a librarian . strohm 's contention is that what chaucer later wrote about in the canterbury tales was his direct recollection of rollicking london life -- the ` socially mixed body of pilgrims ' telling their stories , the fables , adventures and bawdy romps , were a version of what he saw going on out of his window . this is where the book comes into its own , as a description of the city of london in the year 1374 , when chaucer first went up ` an awkward circular flight of stone stairs ' into his apartment in aldgate -- one of the many fortified gatehouses surrounding the capital , when it was encompassed by thick , stone walls . it is hard to imagine now , when london is a big splodge , but 700 years ago , westminster was a separate place from london proper , half-a-mile away along ` clogged footpaths ' . greenwich was a remote fishing village . hampstead and highgate were in the middle of deep countryside , with flocks of sheep . but , in case this starts to sound idyllic , strohm reminds us that next to chaucer 's aldgate was the open sewer known as houndsditch , named after the kennels on the bank of the thames maintained for hunting purposes . dead dogs were chucked in , along with the odd beggar , and ` it stank to high heaven ' . also adjacent was the ` extensive latrine ' maintained by holy trinity church for the clergy . add to this scene the felons ' and traitors ' heads rotting on spikes , and you realise a strong stomach was needed to survive in those germ-prone days . the noise was deafening . iron-wheeled carts rattled beneath chaucer 's window , as did drovers , water-carriers and wood-sellers , shouting and yelling . there were continuous processions of convicts and chanting monks , who belonged to the innumerable religious fraternities . meals were eaten at taverns or from stalls in the street , purchased directly from street-side ovens . no health and safety regulations back then . eating and drinking was supplemented by courtesans from ` the stews of southwark ' or ` unlicensed brothels ' of charing cross plying their trade . to such raucousness must be added the tolling and pealing of the parish bells , which began before dawn and ended only with the night curfew . many medieval legal cases involved trespass , disputes over boundaries and incursions on personal living space . this reflects the congestion of london -- the populace fighting for a little privacy beyond the teeming and insanitary 12 ft-wide streets . with privacy difficult to obtain -lrb- few could afford secluded chambers or an enclosed garden -rrb- , sex could be a bit of a free-for-all , especially after dark when lanterns were extinguished . ` racy incidents , ' says strohm , ` were part of the fodder of daily life .

85	a drug dealer caught with a huge block of cannabis when he was in a serious car crash is in line for a multi-million pound payout . the department of transport had been trying to stop sean delaney profiting from the injuries he suffered in the smash . but yesterday a judge ruled this would have breached eu directives and the 40-year-old father of five should receive compensation despite the ` public revulsion ' . delaney was a passenger in a speeding # 80,000 mercedes roadster driven by a fellow drug dealer who overtook on a bend and ploughed into a car carrying a family . ruling : a judge at the high court said delaney is entitled to compensation . peter and lisa houston and their three . children all suffered serious injuries as well but were awarded only . # 20,000 between them . in the judgment at the high court in london , mr justice jay said : ` many readers may be wondering how it comes about that a drug dealer is entitled to compensation against her majesty 's government in circumstances where he was injured during the course of a criminal joint enterprise . ` the understandable reaction might be : there must be some rule of public policy , reflecting public revulsion , which bars such a claim . the short answer is that there is not . ' delaney , from bedworth , warwickshire , suffered fractures , ruptured organs , amnesia and ` intellectual blunting ' in the november 2006 crash near nuneaton . mr justice jay said : ` readers might think : there must be a rule reflecting public revulsion which bars such a claim . there is not ' when he and the driver , shane pickett , were cut free from the wreckage , a small package of cannabis was found hidden in pickett 's sock and a block the size of a football in delaney 's bomber jacket . pickett was jailed for ten months for dangerous driving and possessing cannabis . no action was taken against delaney , probably because of the severity of his injuries . he demanded compensation from pickett 's insurers but they invoked an exclusion clause in that pickett was under the influence of cannabis and driving dangerously . delaney 's lawyers sued the secretary of state for transport , claiming the exclusion under a clause of the uk uninsured drivers ' agreement was incompatible with the 2009 european motor insurance directive which , in the interests of standardisation , allows no exclusions . the 1999 agreement helps innocent victims of uninsured drivers obtain compensation . in 2011 the court of appeal found against delaney saying he would , or should , have known the mercedes was being used for ` the furtherance of crime ' . but yesterday mr justice jay ruled in his favour , saying the department 's failure to ensure uniformity between uk law and the eu directives was ` so serious that ... it must pay compensation to mr delaney ' . the court found the illegality involved in the journey itself was merely ` scene setting ' and not the cause of the accident . but delaney 's tory mp dan byles said : ` i 'm sure i speak for the majority of my constituents who would be horrified that a drug dealer is getting extremely large amounts of taxpayers ' money for what is essentially a self-inflicted injury . it seems highly unfair . ' dominic raab , the eurosceptic tory mp for esher and walton , said it was absurd ` criminals can sue the government at huge taxpayers ' expense for harm suffered in the course of committing their crimes ' . he said it added ` insult to injury that this nonsense is being forced on us by brussels contrary to all notions of basic democratic accountability ' . accident : delaney was being driven in a ` flashy ' mercedes sl 500 -lrb- left , posed by model -rrb- when it crashed . on rescuing him , emergency services found 240 grams of cannabis -lrb- right , file photo -rrb- . the amount of compensation the department must now pay delaney will be assessed at a later date , but millions are routinely awarded in cases of such serious injury . the houston family , from exhall , near bedworth , were hospitalised after the crash with broken bones , collapsed lungs and bruised kidneys . yesterday mr houston said he was surprised by the judgment . ` if delaney is getting multi millions then it is quite disappointing when we did n't get anything near that , ' said the salesman . ` it seems stupid that the loophole is allowed to exist and the eu law allows him to get that money . ' the family received a new car on top of their compensation , which came from a pot built up by the motor insurers bureau under the uninsured drivers agreement . when approached at his semi-detached home , delaney claimed he had not heard about his court victory . ` all i can say is i 'm in shock , ' he said . ` i have n't been able to work for eight years because apparently i 've got a brain injury . i do n't feel like there 's anything wrong but apparently there is . ' a department for transport spokesman said : ` we thought that the directive was drafted in a wide-enough way to allow governments some autonomy . we are considering an appeal .

wrong . as chelsea failed to deal with morais ' corner , the ball fell to billy knott who found stead on the edge of the box . the former blackburn striker took a touch before firing an unstoppable left-footed rocket past cech . gary cahill puts chelsea ahead with a improvised back-heel effort after 21 minutes against bradford in the fa cup . cahill watches on as his deft effort flies into the top corner , leaving ben williams with no chance . chelsea 's players mob cahill -lrb- third left -rrb- as he celebrates scoring the opening goal . ramires -lrb- second left -rrb- slots home through a crowd of players to score chelsea 's second goal of the game . ramires hugs mohammed salah as he celebrates scoring the second goal for chelsea . this was n't in the script for mourinho 's side . the fa cup writes its own scripts , though . remy tried to restore the home side 's two-goal advantage three minutes into the second period , but his half volley , following some excellent wing play from salah , ballooned wide . but that did n't nullify the momentum bradford had gathered following 's stead 's strike late in the first half . morais and knott both fired wide whilst in good positions as the bantams sensed an equaliser . that was enough for mourinho to send for the cavalry ; willian coming on for salah , while cesc fabregas replaced jon obi mikel , who needed treatment to a head injury after a collision with knott . fabregas made an instant impact , locating oscar with a brilliant flick only for the brazil international to fire wide from a good position before watching drogba head his well-flighted free-kick straight at williams . and a minute later -- the unthinkable happened . james meredith 's long throw was met by andrew davies , whose header found knott who saw his shot parried by cech . but the rebound rolled into the direction of morais . it must have seemed like an eternity for morais as he waited for the ball to drop to his feet at the back post . but it was worth the wait as he slotted home to send the visitor 's into a frenzy . as if the feat of a league one side coming back from two-down against the premier league leaders was n't dramatic enough ; the sub-plot to the equaliser is worth considering . morais and knott were both on chelsea 's books as youngsters . they 'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at stamford bridge during those fledgling days . jon stead -lrb- right -rrb- scores for bradford to make it 2-1 and give the visitors some hope . cech dives in vain to try and stop stead 's effort but comes up short . stead wheels away in celebrates as his bradford team-mates rush to congratulate him . felipe morais -lrb- right -rrb- celebrates making it 2-2 as cesar azpilicueta and petr cech look on helplessly . morais wheels away to celebrate after scoring against his former club . halliday can barely contain his emotion after making it 3-2 to bradford . their dreams had come true , though , perhaps , not in the shirts they 'd envisaged wearing . mourinho responded by throwing on eden hazard -- the change did n't make a blind bit of difference though , as bradford made history . latching on to stead 's lay-off , halliday 's career flashed in front of his eyes in the 82nd minute . this was it . a moment that defines careers . creates heroes . creates legend . and the midfielder did n't choke , quite the opposite in fact , cooly side-footing past cech from the edge of the box . wow . wow . wow . madness erupted from the vocal travelling support and the bantams bench . bradford knew what was coming . the kitchen sink . drogba headed wide , before kurt zouma fired over the bar from close range after ramires ' cut-back . and yet there was more drama , the fourth official signalling seven minutes of stoppage time -- much to parkinson 's annoyance . he need n't have worried , though , as substitute mark yeates notched a fourth after stead 's pass to secure the most famous of wins . mourinho had seen enough ; approaching parkinson before attempting to head down the tunnel early . the bradford boss was n't having any of it , refusing to shake his counterpart 's hand until the final whistle . there were eventually hand shakes . bradford was shaking on saturday night , as well . jose mourinho -lrb- right -rrb- exchanges some angry words with his opposite number parkinson during the first half . oscar tries his luck from distance as chelsea piled on the pressure early on in the game .	 gary cahill and ramires had put chelsea 2-0 up after 38 minutes at stamford bridge .   bradford 's goals came from jon stead , felipe morais , andy halliday and mark yeates .   andre schurrle left out of chelsea squad , fueling speculation he is set to to leave the club . 
95	the bbc is in discussions with the football association about how to make it easier to choose the most exciting fa cup fixtures to broadcast live . the broadcaster received criticism for not showing bradford 's shock 2-0 victory over sunderland in the fa cup fifth round on sunday , electing instead to show aston villa 's match against leicester . bbc football editor mark cole released a statement on monday afternoon which can be read in full below . billy clarke -lrb- centre -rrb- fires bradford ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over sunderland . jon stead -lrb- right -rrb- seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the fa cup fifth round giant killing . phil parkinson was the mastermind of yet another cup shock with bradford city at the valley parade . the statement comes after match of the day two presenter mark chapman on sunday night moved to clarify why the bbc had not shown bradford 's fa cup giant killing against sunderland live on tv . bradford striker jon stead joked during his post-match interview for bbc that the game at valley parade was ' a great cup tie ' and that it ` should have been on the tv ' , a comment that left the interviewer lost for words . back in the studio chapman revealed the reason why chelsea 's conquerors from the previous round had not been shown live , despite the opportunity of another upset being on the cards . ' i do have an answer on that subject , ' the presenter said . ` and it comes from the bbc football management who say the following : ` they had to pick their live games before the replays were played in the fourth round and therefore could n't be sure who bradford would be at home to . if they had been allowed to wait they would have chosen it ' . ' mark chapman confirmed on match of the day two that bradford was not selected for tv because the bbc had to choose the live games before their opponents were known . bradford goalscorer stead joked during his post-match interview that the fifth-round tie against sunderland should have been shown on tv . sunderland needed a replay to beat championship side fulham in the fourth round and the bbc had to select the live games before the tie was decided , with the corporation instead opting to show the all premier league clash between aston villa and leicester . gary lineker had earlier claimed the bbc would have screened bradford 's fifth-round game had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays . and the league one side did n't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at lineker and chapman following the sunderland win . the presenter tweeted : ` the bbc can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays . if they could 've waited bradford would obviously have been chosen . ' gary lineker and mark chapman were subject to a cheeky tweet from bradford city following their victory . match of the day 2 presenter chapman was also targeted by bradford 's cheeky tweet . the tv match selections for the 5th round of the fa cup caused a bit of a reaction yesterday , so i wanted to use this post to explain in a bit more detail how the selection process works . you still might not agree with our picks , particularly if you 're from bradford , but hopefully you 'll see there 's a bit of logic to what we try to do . as gary lineker mentioned yesterday , the hardest thing is that both the bbc and bt have to make our selections before the outcome of replays . that 's the only reason why phil parkinson 's side did n't get a live match this time round . we had to weigh up the options and given sunderland 's recent form , thought it was a realistic possibility of the match being league one against a championship side . in this case it would n't have been much of a shock whatever the result and the winners would be guaranteed a live quarter-final , as reading have done by progressing at derby . if bradford definitely had a home tie against premier league opposition we certainly would have chosen to have the match live on bbc one . that has been a big part of our policy so far , showing afc wimbledon , cambridge , bristol city and tonight preston , all looking to overcome opposition from the top flight . as the game unfolded yesterday at valley parade , we shared the frustration of fans and would have loved to have been broadcasting the match live . it 's everything the fa cup and our new comprehensive coverage is about . we are speaking to the fa about whether we can change this in the future , but understand it 's tricky for them . clubs understandably want to get plans for ticketing , policing and fans in place without waiting for 10 days for tv companies to confirm their selections . but we hope there 's a middle ground where we can get a little more flexibility to ensure we have as much chance as possible of capturing cup classics like yesterday . of course a lot of things are easy in hindsight . we have been really pleased with most of our picks so far and really fortunate to get some proper cup shocks . warrington from the eighth tier overcoming exeter city , blyth spartans winning in dramatic fashion at hartlepool , afc wimbledon running liverpool close and cambridge holding manchester united under the abbey stadium lights . it 's also great to see the difference the tv money can make to these clubs , as well as placing them in the national spotlight with over 7 million viewers tuning in . our audience research also suggests that fans want to enjoy a mix of these david vs. goliath matches and games involving premier league sides . for those who ca n't afford subscription to sports channels , it 's been great to be able to see live international stars like alexis sanchez , angel di maria , steven gerrard , ron vlaar and alex song , all as part of the licence fee . while the aston villa vs. leicester game was n't everyone 's cup of tea , it was a hotly contested midlands derby with both clubs picking full strength sides and produced a cracking second half watched by over 4 million . of course , we would have loved to have been live at chelsea in the 4th round and bradford in the 5th , but the good news for fans is that even when a game is n't shown live there 's always comprehensive match of the day highlights available . there 's a lot more extra coverage devoted to the fa cup on the bbc , with lots of additional content and different ways to enjoy it . after the 4th round , 26 million people had watched the coverage on the bbc , that 's 8 million more than on terrestrial tv this time last season . it 's not all about viewing figures and ratings , but it 's pleasing to be able to bring coverage of the world 's most loved cup competition to such a wide audience . despite some of the criticism coming out of bradford , a lot of thought goes into the matches we pick , and i hope the selections outlined above show we are particularly keen to showcase clubs outside the premier league . i 'm a bristol rovers fan myself so know all too well what the cup can mean to those outside the elite . when we sit down tomorrow morning to pick our two matches for the quarter-final we will take all i 've discussed into consideration , but the good news is that all four matches will be live on tv . that means bradford 's incredible heroics over the last five rounds have guaranteed them a money-spinning quarter-final game and boy do bantams fans deserve it !	 the bbc received criticism for not showing bradford 's shock victory against sunderland in the fa cup fifth round on sunday .   the broadcaster elected to show aston villa 's match against leicester .   the bantams comfortably beat gus poyet 's side 2-0 at the valley parade .   match of the day two presenter mark chapman on sunday night moved to clarify why the bbc had not shown bradford 's fa cup victory .

' barca coach luis erique says dani alves is one of the most upbeat lads he has in the dressing room . argentinian striker messi takes part in training ahead of barcelona 's game with grenada . alves has been a key part of barca 's success in recent years with his probing runs up the right wing and a fine understanding with the likes of argentina forward lionel messi . however , he has sometimes attracted criticism for a perceived weakness in defence and it was his howler that led to malaga 's goal in last weekend 's surprise 1-0 la liga defeat at the nou camp . if alves and barca fail to agree on a new deal it could leave the club without a top-class right back as they have been banned by fifa from participating in the transfer window until january next year . enrique has suggestd he wants brazil international alves to remain at the club beyond the end of this season . messi , mascherano , xavi and gerard pique participate in training session at joan gamper sports city . luis enrique does not appear to have much confidence in martin montoya , who has only made seven appearances this season , and new signing douglas has made just two starts . barca are second in la liga with 14 matches remaining , four behind leaders real madrid , who host villarreal on sunday . champions atletico madrid are three points behind barca in third ahead of sunday 's game at sevilla . enrique has backed alves following his angry reaction to being subbed in the win over manchester city .	 barcelona landed in grenada ahead of saturday 's la liga game .   the catalans will be hoping to close the gap on rivals real madrid .   coach luis enrique has hinted that he wants dani alves to stay at the club .   alves ' contract runs out in the summer and he is yet to agree a new deal .

' . bradford 's players react with joy as the final whistle sounds after booking their place in the fifth round for the first time in 39 years . bradford 's players complete a well-deserved lap of honour at the end after sending sunderland spiralling out of the cup . bradford city fans make themselves heard in a sell-out crowd at valley parade as sunderland became their latest giant-killing victims . sunderland 's john o'shea reacts with dismay after an abject performance saw them dumped out of the cup by league one opposition . john o'shea tries to make an impact for sunderland inside the bradford penalty area as they struggled to create chances at valley parade . sunderland 's steven fletcher and bradford 's filipe morais compete for the ball in acrobatic fashion during the match . a bandaged rory mcardle beats sunderland striker connor wickham to an aerial ball during the fifth round contest . liam bridcutt stretches out a leg to try and rob andrew halliday of the ball as it bounces up . jon stead beats vito mannone to the ball but sees his effort go narrowly wide as wes brown tries to steal in behind them . bradford 's stephen darby fights to keep the ball from sunderland 's ricardo alvarez during the first-half . andrew davies is sent flying through the air as he competes for the ball with sunderland 's bandaged striker danny graham . a bradford supporter dressed in a chicken mask applauds as the two teams emerge from the tunnel .	 bradford city added sunderland to their list of high-profile scalps after fa cup fifth round win at valley parade .   the league one side took a third-minute lead when billy clarke 's firm strike deflected in off john o'shea .   and they claimed a deserved second on the hour after jon stead rifled in against his former club .   the bantams had eliminated chelsea in sensational fashion in the fourth round at stamford bridge .   the crowd chanted ` are you watching bbc ?

' he added : ` it is not all rosy in the garden obviously here , nobody said it was going to be easy . it was a cruel way to lose the game but in the end i thought neither team deserved to win . ' that summation is probably correct , even though stoke once again illustrated their threat away from the britannia . this was a fifth win on the road this season , the club 's best total in premier league history , and all the more impressive given villa had taken the lead . villa 's team-sheet strangely included kevin richardson -lrb- no 18 -rrb- , a former villa player who appeared for the club over twenty years ago . alan hutton attempts to challenge jonathan walters down the wing during the first half as the stoke man puts a cross in . asmir begovic can only watch as sinclair 's header flies into the net to put villa in front while the forward wheels away to celebrate . sinclair scored his second goal in two games after settling last week 's fa cup tie with leicester city with sherwood in the stands . sherwood and his bench jump up to celebrate sinclair 's strike with goals having been hard to come by recently for villa . ` i 'm delighted , ' said mark hughes . ` a lot of people were saying we would get beaten today because we would n't be able to deal with the reaction to tim 's arrival . we stood up to that and did n't allow villa to get any real momentum . ' sherwood must pick himself and his players up quickly , with this loss sending villa down to 19th below burnley . ` we have to put this behind us and not dwell , ' sherwood said . ` i can be devastated now but i wo n't be devastated on monday . games come thick and fast . ' there are just 12 left for sherwood to avert the disaster of a drop to the championship . it had begun brightly , even after an early struggle for lift-off amid a freak hailstone blitz . scott sinclair provided the first goal of the sherwood era , his header worthy of the no 9 on his back . in the 20th minute carles gil hit a corner that drifted all the way to fabian delph on the left flank , with sinclair falling to the floor in a tangle with phil bardsley . he got to his feet quickly and arrived onto delph 's cross to glance the ball in off the far post . he celebrated arms wide , his first premier league strike since august 2012 . it was also the first villa goal in an opening period since december 20 . but stoke found a foothold and began to push back , grabbing an equaliser on the stroke of half-time . stephen ireland took a throw to jonathan walters , who held off substitute aly cissokho and played the ball back . ireland whipped over a cross and mame biram diouf found space between vlaar and alan hutton to nod in . sherwood took charge of his first game at villa park and was delighted with sinclair 's opener that put the home side in front . ciaran clark , delph , benteke and gabriel agbonlahor -lrb- l-r -rrb- all rush in to congratulate sinclair -lrb- centre -rrb- while a stoke defender lies injured . diouf leaps between ron vlaar -lrb- left , challenging -rrb- and hutton -lrb- right , challenging -rrb- to smash a header past brad guzan . diouf is mobbed by his team-mates after equalising while villa captain vlaar trudges back up as the home side prepare to restart play . christian benteke jinks to get away from his marker glenn whelan as the out-of-sorts striker looked to put villa back in front . sherwood , as ever an animated figure on the touchline , reacts to a missed chance for his side with the scores level at 1-1 . diouf tries to get ahead of vlaar inside the penalty area as the powerful forward causes problems for the villa defence in the second half . the second half was a low-key affair , punctuated by frequent injuries . referee east was among those hurt , prompting much mirth . jon walters held up an imaginary substitute board . ` you 're not fit to referee , ' was sung by the holte end . sherwood used the delay to hold a team talk , but there was little improvement from his team . ciaran clark 's header drew a finger-tip save from begovic in the final minute , but it was stoke who struck instead . if he did not know before , sherwood must now realise the scale of his task . roger east needed to add on more time at the end of the match because of a stoppage caused by an injury he suffered . east needed treatment from aston villa 's medical staff as the holte end sang : ` you 're not fit to referee ' to the injured official . vlaar gave away a late penalty to allow stoke the chance to win the game and he held his head on the floor in despair as he was sent off . moses sends guzan the wrong way with his late penalty while villa fans behind the goal attempt in vain to put him off . moses slides in front of the celebrating travelling fans along the side of the pitch as stewards struggle to hold the away support back .	 tim sherwood took charge of his first official game for villa after last week 's 2-1 fa cup win over leicester city .   scott sinclair started for the home side and gave them the lead with a glancing header from fabian delph 's cross .   but mame biram diouf scored a first-half equaliser with another header - steven ireland provided the assist .   ron vlaar gave away a last-minute penalty with a poor challenge on victor moses and was shown a red card .   moses dusted himself down and sent brad guzan the wrong way from the spot to give sherwood a losing start .

106	genghis khan , pictured in this 1780 portrait by pierre duflos , expanded the mongol empire in the 13th century - a time of unusual wet and warm weather . scroll down for video . he was one of the most feared warriors in history , waging bloody war across asia and europe . but genghis khan 's 13th-century rampage may have never happened had it not been for a spell of good weather . the leader of the mongol armies created a vast empire that eventually stretched across china , india , russia and eastern europe . historians used to think his armies of nomadic horsemen were fleeing the bleak , cold and dry mongolian plains for warmer regions . but now scientists have discovered that the rise of the mongol empire coincided with a 14-year spell of weather that was the warmest and wettest for 1,000 years . the academics , from columbia university in new york , discovered the weather anomaly by studying the rings of ancient trees . they think the conditions created those needed for a boost in lush growth of grass , which would have fuelled the soldiers ' horses and fattened their livestock . the good weather lasted from 1211 to 1225 - the exact period when genghis khan and his armies rose to prominence . amy hessl , co-author of the study published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences , said : ` the transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events . ` it was n't the only thing , but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos , develop an army and concentrate power . ` where it 's arid , unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity , and that translates into horsepower . genghis was literally able to ride that wave . ' researchers analysed 17 trees found in the khangai mountains in mongolia , marked at a , to chart a yearly record of rainfall back to 658 ad . they claim that due to the warm and wet weather during genghis ' reign , there would have been an unusual increase in grass production , which would have fuelled a boom in livestock . statue of genghis khan in the tov province , mongolia . originally known as temujin of the borjigin , legend has it genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand . his father was khan , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when temujin was still young . genghis conquered almost four times the lands of alexander the great . before khan rose to power the mongol tribes had been racked by disarray and internal warfare . in the early 1200s he united the tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern korea , china , russia , eastern europe , southeast asia , persia and india . khan made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations . he was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his territories . some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants alive today . genghis khan was the founder and great khan of the mongol empire . in the early 1200s he united the . tribes , creating a military state that invaded its neighbours and . expanded , soon ruling most of what would become modern korea , china , . russia , eastern europe , southeast asia , persia and india . khan made himself master of half the known world , and inspired mankind with a fear that lasted for generations . he . was a prolific lover , fathering hundreds of children across his . territories . some scientists think he has 16 million male descendants . alive today . by the time he died in august 1227 , the mongol empire covered a vast part of central asia and china . originally known as temüjin of the borjigin , legend has it genghis was born holding a clot of blood in his hand . his father was khan , or emperor , of a small tribe but was murdered when temüjin was still young . the new tribal leader wanted nothing to do with temujin 's family , so with his mother and five other children , temüjin was cast out and left to die . in all , genghis conquered almost four times the lands of alexander the great . he is still revered in mongolia and in parts of china . the empire eventually fragmented , but the mongols ' vast geographic reach and their inventions survived . their ideas included an international postal system , organized agriculture research and a civil service based on merit . neil pederson , who co-wrote the paper , said : ` before fossil fuels , grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the mongols and the cultures around them . ` energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem , up the ladder to human society . genghis khan was the founder and great khan of the mongol empire , pictured . after he united nomadic tribes in asia he founded the mongol empire and began invading the rest of the continent of eurasia . by the time he died in august 1227 , the mongol empire covered a vast part of central asia and china . ` even today , many people in mongolia live just like their ancestors did . ' the researchers said the trees , some of them more than 1,000 years old , gave them an indication of what the future could hold for the region , with drought and other extreme weather likely to become more common in central asia . ` this last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future , not just in mongolia but in a lot of inner asia , ' said mr pederson . ` the heat is a double whammy - even if rainfall does n't change , the landscape is going to get drier . ' other historical events that studies say were affected by climate include the disappearance of the maya , the expansion and fall of roman imperial power and the 13th-century collapse of south east asia 's angkor civilisation .	 researchers from west virginia analysed trees in the khangai mountains .   using tree-rings they were able to chart yearly rainfall back to 658 ad .   between 1211 and 1225 - the exact time of the mongols ' rise - central mongolia saw one of its wettest , and warmest , periods for 1,000 years .   researchers claim this weather caused an increase in grass production .   this in turn created a boom in yaks , cattle , sheep and other livestock .   this would have enabled khan to ` travel with a mobile meat supply ' 
107	humans through the ages have wondered what it is like to be a bird but now hi-tech headwear has revealed the complex hunting strategies of falcons . u.s. scientists got a bird 's eye view of falcons ' attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds , which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights . they discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make their attack with precision . scroll down for video . the scientists worked with 13 falconers in europe and the u.s. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds ' point of view -lrb- pictured chasing a crow -rrb- and painstakingly logged the position of the birds in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques . adult falcons have thin tapered wings , which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly . falcons intercept their prey in mid-air after following it at a distance . they keep their target in the centre of their field of vision . to conserve energy , falcons . readjust their flight position so that their prey appears to be . motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , . this helps them . predict the future position of their victim . falcons are able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tail it in a straightforward way . bats and dragonflies use a similar hunting technique . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise . the scientists worked with 13 falconers in europe and the u.s. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds ' point of view and painstakingly logged the position of the falcons in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques . by comparing the position of the targets in the falcons ' visual field , they were able to map the bird 's flight path . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows falcons -lrb- pictured -rrb- to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise . this revealed that if the prey appeared at the centre of the falcon 's field of view , the falcon was probably intending to attack it from a distance and was keeping an eye its target 's every move . however , the birds also used more complicated strategies . suzanne kane , from the university , told live science , said : ` this strategy of heading straight toward the prey at all times is easy to implement , but it involves following a very winding pathway and it turns out to be a very inefficient way of catching prey . ' to boost efficiency , the predatory birds readjusted their flight position so that their prey appeared to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape , which helped the falcons predict the future position of their victim and conserve energy . the falcons were able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tailed it , professor kane said . during pursuit , the falcons appeared to . head off their prey using a strategy called motion camouflage , meaning . they intercept the prey in the least amount of time while also masking . its approach . the scientists discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , which allows them to make a targeted attack . here , the landscape is blurred , but the falcon has zeroed in on its target - the crow -lrb- pictured centre -rrb- . researchers from haverford college , pennsylvania -lrb- pictured with professor suzanne kane , author of the study , centre -rrb- explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air , without having to follow it closely , to give it the predators the element of surprise . previous studies have shown that bats and dragonflies use the same technique . professor kane explained that the falconers made special hoods so that the cameras were fixed tightly to the birds ' heads , but did not impede their view . ` we had some birds who did n't want to wear them , but overall most were unconcerned with the cameras and tolerated the equipment just fine , ' she said . the research , published in the journal of experimental biology , was based upon data from eight different falcons making flights in the u.s. belgium , the netherlands and the uk . the scientists now aim on investigating other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour , including how the birds select their victims from a flock . professor kane said : ` falcons are magnificent , charismatic animals and the falcon 's - eye videos of their hunts are very exciting . ` i can still say that , even though i have spent hours studying them frame by frame using image analysis software . ` this is truly nature red in tooth and claw . there is something really primal and moving about watching that elemental struggle between predator and prey . ' u.s. scientists got a bird 's eye view of falcons ' attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds , which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights . here , a falcon is pictured as it is just about to intercept its prey , a crow . the scientists now aim to investigate other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour , including how the birds select their victims from a flock , using the little head-mounted cameras .	 falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary , allowing them to make targeted attacks on crows .   researchers from haverford college , .   pennsylvania explained that the hunting techniques allow the birds to conserve energy .   they captured the bird 's behaviour using tiny cameras and analysing the recorded flight paths . 
108	nasa is rushing to resolve a spacesuit problem that put the life of an astronaut in danger in 2013 ahead of three important spacewalks . two astronauts onboard the iss will venture outside the station in the suits in the coming days . but while the suits appear to be in working order , engineers are concerned about a recurring issue that led to the helmet flooding previously while an astronaut was in space . us space agency nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem . it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut . the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system . if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the iss -lrb- shown -rrb- . the issue is with a piece of equipment known as the fan pump separator , part of the spacesuit 's temperature control system . ` that is the same area of concern we had back in 2013 when we had the issue of the water in the helmet , ' said kenneth todd , iss operations and integration manager . the trio of upcoming spacewalks will install new docking stations for commercial cargo at the orbiting laboratory . construction of the iss began on 20 november 1998 . it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three . the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles -lrb- 410km -rrb- . it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds -lrb- 450,000 kg -rrb- and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house . it completes an orbit of earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles -lrb- 27,600 km -rrb- per hour . it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of earth , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years . nasa was alerted to the problem when astronauts were doing spacesuit maintenance in december and found that the fan pump in one suit did not speed up as expected . a new fan pump separator that was on board the space station was installed as a replacement ` and it has been working with no issues since that point , ' said mr todd . however , when nasa commander barry wilmore was scrubbing cooling loops on another us spacesuit on january 20 , he heard an ` abnormally loud fan pump separator , ' according to nasa 's blog of space station activities . ` we were doing the same kind of activity and encountered the same type of failure , ' mr todd told reporters . ` that got us thinking : what has changed ? what is happening ? ' a new spacesuit was shipped to the outpost and will be worn by mr wilmore during the spacewalks . the other spacesuit , with the replacement part , will be worn by fellow astronaut terry virts . its fan pump separator has shown some signs of corrosion , but it is working , todd said . ` the two suits we are going out with have operated every time we turned them on , ' he said . engineers believe that small amounts of water are building up in the bearings inside the fan pump separator each time the suit is powered up and powered down , leading to corrosion over time . the upcoming spacewalks will be performed by nasa astronauts barry wilmore -lrb- left -rrb- and terry virts -lrb- right -rrb- . the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10 pm gmt -lrb- 7.10 am est -rrb- and lasting about six hours . the issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned italian astronaut luca parmitano during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water , mr todd said . ` with the water in the helmet , that was a totally different root cause issue . that was an issue with port holes getting clogged up in the water separator , that was due to the water chemistry , ' he explained . ` that is not an issue here . what we are talking about is a failure of the pump to start up . that in itself is not a water-type of event . ' if the pump were to fail , the astronauts would have to end their spacewalk and return to the hatch . ` this is not a risk to the crew in terms of loss of life , ' said todd . the issue is related to the water-in-helmet leak that nearly drowned italian astronaut luca parmitano during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered -lrb- shown here in this image from the iss -rrb- - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water . a final decision about whether or not the spacewalks - known as extra-vehicular activities , or evas - can begin friday as planned depends on the outcome of further tests , and should be announced later today . ` all indicators are - based on all the data from the ground testing as well as the testing of the suits on orbit - is that we will work our way through this and these suits are going to be okay . but we have some open work left to do , ' said mr todd . the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10 pm gmt -lrb- 7.10 am est -rrb- and lasting about six hours . the astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station . the ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from cape canaveral , florida once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017 . boeing and spacex are in the process of completing their respective crew vehicles , which will restore the united states ' ability to send astronauts to low-earth orbit after the retirement of the space shuttle program in 2011 .	 us space agency nasa is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem .   it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut .   the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system .   if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the iss .   three important spacewalks are scheduled to take place soon .   the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march .   they are needed to install equipment for docking ports that will allow manned private spacecraft to dock with the space station in 2017 . 
109	my wife and i have been to nice every summer for the last five years . why ? because it 's like being on a cruis . everything is right on your doorstep , especially the sparkling sea . anyone who climbs to the park on a hill called the colline du chateau , at the east end of town , will see what i mean . from here you can watch the planes - far enough out to sea to be inaudible - as they approach the airport at the west tip of the bay on which nice stands . not exactly like blackpool : nice has long been a seafront favourite with british travellers . arriving passengers can board a bus that leaves from outside the terminal and skirts the sea for 20 minutes , then you 're in the middle of the bay , where most of the hotels are located . this is the promenade des anglais , named after the britons who launched nice as a holiday resort - albeit a winter one - 200 years ago . you still hear a lot of english voices , and the niçoise french are not as intimidatingly chic as the parisians : they tend to be overripe ladies with small fluffy dogs in tow . they get through a lot of the staple niçoise drink - rosé - while basking at the seafront cafes . the city , with its sparkling sea and hinterland of slumberous villas , is more beautiful than any british resort , but it is bracingly reminiscent of some of the more rackety ones . the stony beach - the penance you pay for entering the turquoise sea - reminds me of brighton . the palm trees along the centre of the prom are fairy-lit at night , like a more tasteful blackpool . the manager of the most select hotel , le negresco , would be appalled to learn that its belle Époque architecture reminds me of the grand hotel , scarborough . the grand is no longer grand but le negresco keeps its end up : a glass of wine in its stately bar costs around # 25 . so we do n't stay there , but at the hyatt regency palais de la méditerranée , a couple of blocks along . the original palais , built in 1930 , was a general house of fun , with a restaurant , casino and theatre . by the year 2000 , it had fallen into decay and was rebuilt as a hotel , although the lovely art-deco façade is preserved . the palais is not extortionate - no tip-hungry porter is thrust upon you at check-in - but it is still glamorous , like nice itself . with all due respect to blackpool and scarborough , you would n't catch bono , elton john , sean connery or bill gates living there , as they do in nice . the city stars in many films featuring beautiful people involved in shady business , including the jewel of the nile -lrb- kathleen turner and michael douglas -rrb- , ronin -lrb- robert de niro and natascha mcelhone -rrb- and the day of the jackal -lrb- the jackal , played by edward fox , naturally stays at le negresco -rrb- . but nice is one of the less expensive jewels on the côte d'azur . big screen : films such as the day of the jackal -lrb- left -rrb- and the jewel of the nile have used nice as a backdrop . it does not exist solely to exploit tourists . the streets inland of the front are full of the french being french : smoking in café terraces ; discussing their ailments in the numerous pharmacies . when my wife lisa and i ask the way to the museum of modern art , nobody knows . perhaps it is the profusion of museums and galleries that causes the confusion . nice has more than any french city except paris . many are run by the municipality , and these are free . we like the ones close to the prom - partly , i admit , because we ca n't be bothered to walk far in the heat . the musée masséna , a blessedly cool 19th-century mansion featuring many paintings of old nice , is right on the prom , at no. 35 . five minutes inland , at 33 avenue des baumettes , is the musée des beaux-arts , formerly the residence of a ukranian princess . it is full of paintings even i can appreciate -lrb- thank goodness for post-impressionism -rrb- . there never seems to be more than half a dozen visitors , so i pad around the elegant rooms pretending it 's my house . at the westward base of the colline is the old town , with its medieval alleyways , baroque churches and the most interesting shops , including maison auer , at 7 rue saint-francoise de paule , which is unchanged since 1820 , and sells glacé fruits . lisa likes the antique/bric-a-brac market held in the main square of the old town , the cours saleya , every monday . my role is to follow her about carrying the linen napkins she buys in bulk . the square is lined with restaurants serving good italian and niçoise food . our favourite is la favola , where you dine on a terrace under art nouveau street lamps . seafood and pasta are the specialities , and everything is on a huge scale . plates are 2ft across ; the olive oil comes in a sort of petrol can . at night , the green hill of the colline - atmospherically illuminated - soars above the old town like a vision of heaven . immediately east of the hill lies the small harbour , where the yachts of the billionaires look somehow less brash than those in monaco , 12 miles along the coast . i always visit monaco when in nice , mainly for the scenic train ride , which costs around # 6 for a return ticket . in monaco , an entry-level property costs # 5 million , whereas in nice , you can buy a two-bedroom flat with sea view for a twentieth of that - my retirement dream . british airways -lrb- 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com -rrb- flies from london to nice from # 68 return . double . rooms at the hyatt regency palais de la méditerranée -lrb- 0033 04 9327 . 1234 , nice.regency.hyatt.com -rrb- cost from # 150 -lrb- room only -rrb- .	 nice , a jewel of the cote d'azur , has long been popular with british tourists .   its main seafront drag , promenade des anglais , is lined with cafes and bars .   many movies have been set here , including classic the day of the jackal .

' the cia revelations come after barack obama 's administration came under sharp attack over its handling of the incident amid claims washington told officers on the ground to ` stand down ' before the rescue took place . attack : a u.s. ambassador and three other americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 . ` there . was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground , by . people at every u.s. organization that could play a role in assisting . those in danger , ' the official added . ` there were no orders to anybody to stand down in . providing support . ' in the first days after the attack , various administration officials . linked the benghazi incident to the simultaneous protests around the . muslim world over an american-made film that ridiculed islam 's prophet . muhammad . only later did they publicly attribute it to militants , . possibly linked to al-qaeda , and acknowledged it was distinct from the . film protests . the changing explanations have led to suspicions that the . administration did n't want to acknowledge a terror attack on u.s. personnel so close to the nov. 6 election , a charge obama has strongly . denied . inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior . siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours . according to the timeline , around 9:40 p.m. benghazi time , officials at the cia 's relatively fortified and well-defended base in benghazi got a call from state department officials at the u.s. diplomatic mission about a mile away that the less-fortified public mission complex had come under attack from a group of militants . other official sources said that the initial wave of attacks on the diplomatic mission involved setting fires using diesel fuel . 9.40 pm - cia officials in ` the annex ' get a distress call from the consulate saying they are under attack . 10.05 pm - armed only with handguns , team of about six cia security officers leave their base for the public diplomatic mission compound . 10.30 pm -

u.s. personnel who had been working or staying at the mission all accounted for , except for ambassador stevens . 11.40 pm - driving back to the secure base , the evacuees come under further fire . 12am -

114	wilfried bony has been truly outstanding for swansea city and manchester city will know they are getting a top-quality player . his # 30million move to the etihad looks like it will be completed soon . city are getting a brilliant striker to add to their already top-notch resources . here , martin keown assesses bony 's strengths ... manchester city look set to sign wilfried bony after opening talks with swansea city over a # 30million deal . bony fires in a goal against queens park rangers for swansea at loftus road on new year 's day . bony was pictured at the airport on wednesday as he headed for the africa cup of nations . he was pictured with his agent -lrb- right -rrb- as he prepared to head out and represent the ivory coast . the perfect blend of power and pace . when bony is on the move , defenders simply bounce off him . he is so powerful and direct that he just swats opponents aside . he embarrasses defenders because they ca n't lay a glove on him . but there is great touch and skill to go with that immense strength . he is good on the ball and his ability to launch off his left or right foot is similar to sergio aguero . he explodes past players in the same way . bony is so good at shifting his bodyweight and that makes it hard for defenders to read him and deal with him - once he 's past you , there is no catching him . he also likes to stay central and as high up the pitch as he can so that when he runs off the shoulder of a defender , he can minimise the number of touches he needs before he can get a shot in . and when he does get a shot away , he has fantastic composure in front of goal . a man who loves to use his head . at six foot , bony is no slouch , but he loves competing in the air . for somebody who 's so good on the ball , that is quite unusual . he really enjoys getting on the end of crosses and has said in the past he only needs one from his team-mates to score . he has n't scored a header so far this season but he might fare better at city . bony plays in a similar way to sergio aguero - he can be a great replacement or a brilliant partner . the ivorian forward loves to use his head as well , demonstrated against qpr on new year 's day . swansea 's crossing accuracy in 2014-15 is the second worst in the league , whereas city 's is the fourth best . if they can feed bony regularly then he is bound to keep scoring . he 's quite similar to radamel falcao when it comes to heading - neither are huge but they beat opponents to the ball out of sheer desire . he wants to be first to it every time and uses his power well to make sure he is . bony celebrates after scoring for swansea against qpr during the 1-1 draw at loftus road on new year 's day . not just a selfish striker . bony 's primary function is to score goals , but he is excellent at bringing others into the game . if he comes deep his first thought is to see which of his team-mates is in the most dangerous position and he will try to find them . he 's got quick , nimble feet , so he is able to pull off great bits of skill and he has a good awareness of how play is developing around him . he plays with real imagination and moving to city to play with the likes of aguero and david silva will only improve that . bony and his team-mates celebrate his goal at anfield against liverpool , who opted against signing the striker . he has interested a number of clubs having scored the most premier league goals in the calendar year . experience tells . bony is 26 but city are getting a player at the peak of his powers . it is a dream move so credit to him for working hard for years in the czech republic and holland to progress . that time has served him well but swansea also deserve credit for giving him a chance to shine where others ignored him . the competition at city will be tough , but he has already seen what it 's like not to play in every game - he was rotated by garry monk over christmas almost as preparation to see how swansea would cope without him . bony , pictured climbing above the arsenal defence in march , says he always tries to be in the right place . the ivorian scores past manchester city goalkeeper joe hart in november as swansea lost 2-1 at the etihad .	 wilfried bony is close to moving to manchester city for # 30million .   swansea city striker is a powerhouse who bounces off defenders .   he moves like sergio aguero and can be an ideal stand-in for argentine .   bony could also form a magnificent partnership with aguero for city .   the ivorian is extremely intelligent and loves to score headers .   read : bony will bring mental and physical strength to manchester city .

' farrell said she did n't tell anyone what had happened for years . ` the first five to seven years after it happened , i was scared , ' she told the radio station .

116	crumbs bakery has learned the hard way that building a business on a fad is no cakewalk . when crumbs , the new york city-based chain that built its business around cupcakes , shuttered all of its 48 remaining locations monday , it seemed like an abrupt ending for a company that opened a decade ago to ride the wave of popularity of the sugary treat sparked by the tv series sex and the city . but crumbs ' rise and fall is n't surprising when considering the company 's dependence on a culinary craze . in fact , it 's the latest cautionary tale for businesses that devote their entire menus to variations of a single product . scroll down for video . harbinger of doom : crumbs shuttered all its 48 locations a week after the struggling cupcake shop operator was delisted from the nasdaq . how crumbs crumbled : experts say crumbs bakery 's bankruptcy was caused by over-expansion at a time when demand for cupcakes leveled off . krispy kreme , for instance , expanded rapidly in large part on the cult-like following of its doughnuts . but sales started declining and the company ended up closing some locations . last year , restaurant industry researcher technomic said krispy kreme had 249 locations , down from 338 a decade ago . the chain has broadened its menu more recently . executives at krispy kreme , which celebrates its 77th anniversary later this week , were n't available for comment . a similar fate befell mrs. fields , which is known for its cookies . the chain has suffered in part because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies , and it was down to 230 stores last year , from 438 a decade ago . tcby had 355 stores last year , down from 1,413 a decade ago . part of the chain 's problem is the competition , given the proliferation of frozen yogurt places . a representative for the parent company of mrs. fields and tcby was n't immediately available . companies that only offer one item can fall victim to a number of risks . for one , trendy products tend to attract competition from big and small players that want to jump on the bandwagon . for instance , starbucks and cold stone creamery have been trying to capitalize on the cupcake trend with cake pops and ice cream cupcakes , respectively . where it all started : the cupcake craze can be traced back to sex and the city -lrb- pictured -rrb- , which popularized the frosted mini-cakes sold by magnolia bakery in the 90s . diversified : magnolia , which now has 7 u.s. locations , offers a variety of desserts , including cakes , pies , cookies and brownies . being beholden to a single item also makes companies more susceptible to customers ' whims and changing tastes . there 's always a new fad : frozen yogurt ; chopped salads ; freshly squeezed juices , and even gourmet toast . entrepreneurs may be eager to open stores selling these products , but there 's always the danger that fickle customers will move on to the next thing . ' a cupcake shop today ca n't survive on just cupcakes , ' said darren tristano , a technomic analyst . to combat the risks , many chains diversify their menus . and several have prospered by moving beyond their flagship products . dunkin' donuts , for instance , has been pushing aggressively into specialty drinks and sandwiches , with a focus on boosting sales after its morning rush hour . and starbucks has introduced a range of new foods and drinks in its cafes , including premium bottled juices and salad boxes . the coffee chain even plans to expand wine and beer offering in evenings to as many as 1,000 locations over the next several years . magnolia , another popular new york city cupcake shop , is credited for sparking the cupcake craze after it was featured in sex and the city . downsizing : krispy kreme , which celebrates its 77th anniversary this week , had 249 locations last year , down from 338 a decade ago . streamlined : the chain mrs fields took a hit because of the ubiquity of places that sell cookies and closed down nearly half of its 438 storefronts . freeze out : the frozen yogurt business tcby had 355 stores last year , down from 1,413 a decade ago , because of stiff competition . the chain , which opened in 1996 , has endured while many of the cupcake shops that opened up in its wake -- including crumbs -- focused on just cupcakes . that 's in part because magnolia , which now has 7 u.s. locations , offers a variety of desserts , including cakes , pies , cookies , brownies and banana pudding . sara gramling , magnolia 's spokeswoman , said the company is learning about the dangers of focusing too heavily on one product , as well as expanding too quickly . ` we 'll be mindful of those lessons , ' she said . still , some chains manage to persevere by carving out a niche where there are n't many competitors ; auntie anne 's and cinnabon have expanded locations over the years . as for crumbs , the company noted in a statement late monday that it was evaluating its ` limited remaining options . ' that will include a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing . crumbs did not provide comment beyond its statement . while some business analysts were quick to conclude that crumbs ' collapse heralded the end of the decade-long cupcake trend , others suggested that the bakery chain was a special case . decade-long fad : crumbs first opened its doors in march 2003 in manhattan . the company went public in 2011 but has been suffering as the cupcake boom has deflated . david sax , author of the tastemakers : why we 're crazy for cupcakes but fed up with fondue , described crumbs ' failure as ` a classic tale of overexpansion and borrowing too much money , ' adding that it was no indicative of the state of the cupcake industry at large , reported the washington post . in sax 's retelling of the story , crumbs ' fatal flaw was that the chain continued opening more and more stores even as demand for cupcakes levelled off . by 2013 , the bakery had 70 locations , which brought in less than $ 650,000 each . last cupcake : before the crumbs empire crumbled , employees at likeable media in new york city bought this sprinkled cupcake from the now-shuttered shop on 42nd street for $ 3.95 . four years earlier , each of crumbs ' 25 locations raked in $ 1.2 million in sales . sax insisted that the frosted mini-cakes have a bright future . ` this is much more a story about one company 's mismanagement of its product line than it is about the hatred or falling off of one particular american pastry , ' he said . ` when the housing market crashed in 2007 or 2008 , it was n't like people stopped investing in real estate . ` the death of crumbs does n't mean the end of every other cupcake bakery .

121	ten pounds might seem a little pricey for a tube of toothpaste . however , in an era of the # 60 smart toothbrush and research suggesting a hollywood smile is key to getting a good job , it could be a price worth paying . unilever has unveiled a new toothpaste and serum it claims can regenerate 82per cent of tooth enamel after just three days of use . the new regenerate enamel science advanced toothpaste contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate , which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth . its new regenerate enamel science . advanced toothpaste contains calcium silicate and sodium phosphate , . which effectively re-builds a new layer of white enamel on the teeth . the company is presenting the toothpaste as a beauty product that will sit alongside expensive age-defying creams and potions . the system helps to form a fresh supply of minerals which wrap and integrate in to the surface of the teeth . the . technology appears to work much like re-plastering a wall , filling any . microscopic holes caused by fizzy drinks or sugary foods to leave a . strong , smooth finish . the . company claims this has the effect of restoring teeth to their original . whiteness while making them much stronger , which means they are less . likely to develop cavities . unilever . says the technology requires the use of a ` boosting serum ' treatment , . which costs another # 30 , once a month and is applied using two . custom-fit mouth trays . toothpaste . manufacturers are constantly looking for new science , pack designs or . marketing initiatives to make it appear new , exciting and able to . command a higher price . the company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days . uk . sales are estimated at more than # 400million a year , while the global . market is put at around # 8billion , which delivers rich pickings to . global brands like oral b and colgate . unilever . launched the new product yesterday at selfridges in a bid to play up . its beauty product credentials - and it will be going in to the boots . chain from june 11 . research . expert at unilever , fred schafer , who developed the science behind the . toothpaste , said : ` it is not generally understood that 80 per cent of . common teeth problems , such as cavities and yellowing , can be caused by . acid attacks and enamel erosion . ` the erosion process happens to . everyone , at all ages , day after day and is caused by common items such . as carbonated drinks , fruit and vegetables , juices and wine . ` the problem is that when enamel -- the outermost protective layer of our teeth -- is lost , our body can not regenerate it . ` this product is the world 's first system . able to reverse the early , invisible stages of this erosion process and . regenerate enamel with exactly the same mineral tooth enamel is made . of . ' the two key ingredients in the toothpaste are calcium silicate and sodium phosphate . calcium silicate is most commonly derived from limestone and is used heavily in the production of building materials such as cement . it is also found in table salt and used as an antacid to treat heartburn . sodium phosphate is a term for a variety of salts used in processed food to control acid levels and help soften bread . they feature in medicines such as treatments for constipation . the technology is the result of work at the unilever research and development laboratory at port sunlight , on merseyside , as well as teams in milan and shanghai . it was developed in collaboration with dental experts from international oral health research centres and the underlying science is due to be published in the journal of dentistry . the company claims that test tube experiments have proved it can restore 82per cent of tooth enamel after three days . as a result , teeth are said to be three times stronger . however , the company faces an uphill struggle to convince a sceptical public that regenerate is any better than cheaper , rival products which claim to have a similar effect . for example , sensodyne toothpaste , which costs # 4.49 , promotes itself on the basis it is possible to treat the pain of sensitive teeth by repairing vulnerable areas of tooth enamel with a formula that includes calcium and phosphate . earlier this week , a leading british social scientist said the state of a person 's teeth , rather than their education , is becomingly increasingly important in terms of determining their job prospects and social status . malcolm gladwell argued that bad teeth . and being overweight are becoming the new benchmarks of inequality . he . suggested those with bad teeth are given a lower chance of success . because they are denied certain entry-level jobs . he said : ` that 's kind of the way we 're . moving as the gap between the fit and the unfit grows . the teeth thing . and the obesity problems are the same : they are symptoms of the same set . of inferences that are being drawn . malcolm gladwell suggested those with bad teeth have a lower chance of success because they are denied certain jobs . nowadays many , particularly celebrities like victoria beckham , get work done on their teeth . ` i think those kinds of physical characteristics - that 's completely the next wave of discrimination . ' it is evident that people in the public eye increasingly feel under pressure to have a perfect white smile , which is permeating through the rest of the population . a poll conducted last year by visioncritical also found that people see whiter teeth as an indication of wealth . the survey showed that people with whiter teeth were thought to earn # 10,000 more on average than they actually did . sparkling teeth also made them look up to five years younger and improved their employment potential by 10 per cent , results showed . eddie crouch from the british dental association has identified a noticeable gap between middle-class teenagers , whose parents are able to afford to have braces , and others who can not .	 regenerate enamel science advanced toothpaste creates new layer .   fills in microscopic holes made by fizzy drinks or sugary foods .   unilever claims technology requires use of # 30 ` boosting serum '

'' ' david cameron replaced a succession of older male ministers with up-and-coming tory women in an attempt to make his top team more representative of the population . although former tv host miss mcvey was arguably the star turn in downing street , one of the biggest winners was liz truss , who entered the cabinet as environment secretary at the age of 38 , making her the youngest female cabinet minister of all time . the ice-cool mother-of-two , increasingly tipped as a potential future tory leader , replaced owen paterson , who clashed angrily with the prime minister as he was sacked after criticism of his handling of the horsemeat scandal , a cull of badgers and the winter floods . the other major promotion was handed to nicky morgan , promoted from no 3 at the treasury to replace michael gove as education secretary . the prime minister declared his new team ` reflected modern britain ' , but faced a backlash from some of the tory old guard who accused him of culling middle-aged male ministers regardless of their merits . former tv host miss mcvey was hailed the star turn in downing street yesterday after her glamorous turn before photographers . liz truss : the new environment secretary is very patriotic in a red , white and blue ensemble consisting of a snake-skin navy dress and red jacket oddly finished with black patent shoes . miss truss , 38 , mp for south west norfolk and the former junior education and children minister , looked bright and sensible but a little bit too eighties air hostess . penny mordaunt : the minister for planning and coastal communities was alone in braving the no-jacket look - after all she was brave enough to appear on tv in a swimsuit on splash ! this rather tight , bright , purple dress - the # 115 ` viola ' by lk bennett - makes the most of 41-year-old miss mordaunt 's figure . but who knows what 's with the mp for portsmouth north 's wrinkly nude shoes and big bag ? the new leader of the house of lords is to have her salary topped up by the tory party after it emerged she was to be paid less than her male predecessor , lord hill . tina stowell was announced as the new lords leader , but there was embarrassment as downing street confirmed that she would be paid # 78,891 a year , compared to # 101,038 for lord hill . after labour criticism , tory sources said it had been decided to boost lady stowell 's salary using party funds . there was particular anger that not one existing woman minister was axed in mr cameron 's biggest clear-out since becoming party leader . mps had expected helen grant , the sports minister , who has made a series of gaffes , to be dismissed , and there were question marks over the future of foreign office minister baroness warsi after she poked fun at the prime minister 's eton schooling . ` what do you have to do as a woman to get sacked by cameron ? ' asked one ousted minister . ` no matter how hopeless or how provocative you are , you wo n't get sacked because he has to meet his quotas . ' another senior tory complained : ` this really is the worst form of tokenistic gesture politics . merit is out of the window .

123	profits made by energy firms on household bills have more than doubled in a year , damning new figures reveal . as the big six companies drive through price hikes of up to 10 per cent , it also emerged that the costs to them of buying gas and electricity has remained almost unchanged since autumn 2012 . increases in what energy companies pay for gas and electricity have added just # 10 to household bills , but profit margins added # 50 in a year . price hikes : despite gas and electricity wholesale and operating costs remaining almost unchanged since autumn 2012 , the big six companies have pushed through price hikes of up to 10 % . soaring profits : this graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up . the wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable . bosses responsible for crippling rises this winter are due to be grilled by mps tomorrow about claims they are driving up costs to make even bigger profits while leaving customers to choose between heating and eating . david cameron is under intense pressure to tackle soaring bills , after labour demanded a two-year freeze and former tory prime minister sir john major called for a windfall tax to help the elderly to keep warm this winter . four of the big six firms have already announced big price rises , with scottishpower bills going up by 9 per cent , npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , british gas a 9.2 per cent rise and scottish & southern energy an 8.2 per cent increase . the firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices , bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government . but official figures released by energy regulator ofgem reveal company profits have doubled in a year . mr cameron said last week : ` i think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially , but we have to look at the causes of why bills are going up and act on those causes rather than just have some sort of blanket policy that does n't work . ' ofgem analysis shows that the average bill stood at # 1,320 this month , up # 70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year . the price hikes will add # 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than # 100 . wholesale energy costs -- which make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed , up just 1.67 per cent or # 10 in a year . vat , operating and other costs make up # 1,255 of the bill , up # 40 or 3.29 per cent . however the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills , up 111 per cent from # 45 in 2012 to # 95 now . caroline flint , labour 's shadow energy secretary , said : ` energy companies always blame rising global energy prices for putting up people 's bills , but these figures show that under david cameron they 've been increasing their profits on the back of spiralling energy bills for hard-pressed households . ` if energy companies wo n't treat . their customers fairly , then people deserve tough action from the . government . but david cameron shows how out of touch he is , refusing to . act . that 's why labour would freeze energy bills for 20 months and . create a tough new watchdog with the power to force energy companies to . cut their prices when the cost of energy falls . ' prime minister david cameron is under pressure to tackle soaring energy bills but came under fire last week when he suggested ` rolling back ' green levies which he claims are pushing up prices . the revelation will fuel public anger at near double-digit rises in bills at a time when wages are up by around one per cent . ofgem admits that overall wholesale costs have soared in the last decade , up by around 140 per cent for electricity and 240 per cent for gas . although in the last year wholesale costs have barely changed . however , power firms insist that future prices for them to buy in supplies for this winter have risen . the wholesale price of gas for use this winter is 8 per cent higher than the price of gas for use last winter , ofgem says . the wholesale price of electricity is 13 per cent higher . mr cameron sparked a furious coalition row last week when he vowed to ` roll back ' the green levies which he says are forcing up bills . over many years ` extras ' have been added on all bills to pay to help the elderly heat their homes and cut the cost of energy efficiency measures like insulation . ofgem estimates that in the last decade environmental and social costs have risen from # 10 to over # 100 on the average bill . in the last year they have risen by around # 10 to # 115 of an average annual dual fuel household bill . more increases are expected . however , the energy firms disputed the way ofgem calculated the figures . british gas said : ` the prices that individual suppliers pay depend on their own hedging strategies , and the ofgem methodology is , at best , an approximation of what those hedging profiles are . ` we buy a certain amount of gas more than two years in advance , and if you look at the 24 month figure to october 2013 , there has been an 18 per cent increase in the wholesale cost . ' sse insisted it was ` simply false ' to suggest wholesale costs had not risen . a spokesman added : ` this is very much a global market and we are seeing increased international competition for supplies , which is putting up prices .

124	blow : alex salmond , the snp leader , whose claims scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the eu are sounding increasingly unlikely -lrb- file picture -rrb- . if scotland voted for independence it could have to re-apply to a whole host of international organisations including the eu and the world bank , laywers said . it would also have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties , according to legal advice commissioned by whitehall . the report is a huge blow to alex salmond , the snp leader , whose claims scotland would not have to apply to join groups such as the eu are sounding increasingly unlikely . the legal advice concludes that scotland would become a ` new state ' while the remaining united kingdom would be considered a ` continuing state ' . so if scotland seceded , only the rest of the uk would continue to have the same rights , obligations and powers under international law . the uk is a party to 14,000 treaties and is a member of groups such as the un , the eu , nato , interpol and the international monetary fund . the 57-page report , written by professors james crawford and alan boyle , raises the prospect that scotland will have to apply to re-join many of these if it votes for independence in a referendum next year . david cameron said : ` those glorious olympics last summer reminded us just what we were capable of when we pull together : scottish , english , welsh , northern irish , all in the same boat -- sometimes literally . if you told many people watching those olympics around the world that we were going to erect barriers between our people , they 'd probably be baffled . put simply : britain works . britain works well . why break it ? ' addressing matters of the ` heart and head ' , mr cameron said britain has built up ` world-renowned ' institutions such as the nhs and bbc , and ` fought for freedom in two world wars , leaving ` unbreakable bonds ' . he said : ' i have no time for those who say there is no way scotland could go it alone . ' i know first-hand the contribution scotland and scots make to britain 's success - so for me there 's no question about whether scotland could be an independent nation . ` the real question is whether it should - whether scotland is stronger , safer , richer and fairer within our united kingdom or outside it . ' scotland 's deputy first minister , nicola sturgeon , said mr cameron had simply reminded people that ` he heads a government that scotland did n't vote for and that independence is the only way to ensure that scotland always gets the government it votes for ' . a report from the first minister 's council of economic advisers suggested scotland should retain sterling as currency in the event of independence . holding on to the pound would also benefit the rest of the uk as a key trading partner , the report concludes . professor crawford , of cambridge university , is an australian state counsel , similar to a qc . professor boyle is an expert on international disputes . their opinion was requested last year by the foreign and cabinet offices in london and the advocate general office in edinburgh . agreement : if scotland gained independence , following a referendum agreed by alex salmond and david cameron last year , scotland would have to renegotiate 14,000 international treaties .	 scotland would have to re-apply to organisations including eu .   remainder of uk would continue to have same international powers .   report is ` huge blow ' to alex salmond .

' i never signed on for having that image used for another purpose , ' she said in an interview . when the photo was tweeted to her @lenorezann two weeks ago , she asked the sender to remove the image , which she said included a message that said , ` what happened to the old lenore ? ' the tweeter , nickscissons @ncissons , a 17-year old high school student from truro , said he meant it as a joke .

' scissons replied , arguing the photo was public on the internet . during the exchange , which lasted around three hours , zann said she felt increasingly picked on . ' i never signed on for having that image used for another purpose , ' she said in an interview . ' i signed a contract ... for my image only to be used in ` the l word ' show . it 's not just the image of the picture that was disturbing . it was the way that these people ... suddenly targeted me . it increased in velocity and intent . it was constant and it was harassing . ' i was being cyberbullied so i felt that i needed to call the police . the police suggested that i call the cyberscan unit as well and that 's what they 're there for . that 's why we legislated them , so that they 'd be there to help people who feel that they are being bullied by other people online , ' she said . ` it was twitter where i was being tweeted at . i was being sworn at . they were swearing at me . they were disrespectful . it was constant . it was harassment and it was frightening . i was afraid . so that for me accounts for my feeling that i was being bullied . and because it 's online , that 's cyberbullying .

132	even though she was 19 and he was 45 , sultry lauren bacall and gritty humphrey bogart were meant for each other . but they were meant for others too . throughout their marriage bogie carried on an affair with a mexican starlet turned secretary . and bacall - known as betty to their pals - fell madly in love with frank sinatra and began a steamy relationship with him while bogie was on his death bed with throat cancer . bacall , who died at her home in los angeles on tuesday of a stroke , fell in with a fast crowd when she wed bogart . ` i knew everybody because i was married to bogie , and that 25-year difference was the most fantastic thing for me to have in my life , ' she said . the most famous actors , writers , artists were now in her inner circle because of they sought out her husband . scroll down for video . ring a ding ding : lauren bacall began her tumultuous affair with frank sinatra when humphrey bogart was dying of cancer . they went public with their romance after bogie died . threesome : did bogie know that his wife was destined to sleep with his close friend ? bacall says that bogie knew how much she loved to spend time with sinatra - and that sinatra was in love with her . bogie and bacall formed a group they called the holmby hills rat pack -- a branch of the famed las vegas tribe , named after the neighborhood bordering beverly hills and bel air . it was a tight inner circle of stars dedicated to drinking , laughing and partying into the wee hours . sinatra was pack master ; judy garland , first vice-president ; sid luft , judy 's husband , the cage master ; superagent irving ` swifty ' lazar was recording secretary ; novelist nathaniel benchley , historian ; and bacall , den mother . they were constantly together . once , after a new year 's party in palm springs , bacall , known as ` betty ' , wanted she and bogie to stay and hang out with frank , since the blue-eyed crooner did not have a woman with him that night . bogie insisted they go home and told her , ' you must always remember we have a life of our own that has nothing to do with frank . he chose to live the way he 's living -- alone . it 's too bad if he 's lonely , but that 's his choice . we have our road to travel , never forget that -- we ca n't live his life ' , writes biographer kitty kelley . when bogie learned he had throat cancer in february 1956 , the diagnosis , surgery and radiation came too late and one of hollywood 's biggest stars was told he had less than a year to live . sinatra , came to visit him frequently , kept him laughing by recounting the practical jokes going on with the other rat pack members . out and about : betty and frank were seen together at restaurants , premieres , dinner parties and weekends in palm springs . she was deeply in love and wanted to marry him . ` it was n't easy for him , ' kelley quotes bacall . ` i do n't think he could bear to see bogie that way or bear to face the possibility of his death . yet he cheered bogie up when he was with him -- made him laugh -- kept the ring-a-ding act in high gear for him ' . sinatra worshipped bogart but there was also something brewing between the singer and bacall . they were falling in love while bogie was dying of cancer . by october , eight months later , to celebrate bacall 's thirty-second birthday , frank sent a chartered plane to los angeles to fly some of their closest friends to the sands in vegas where he was playing at the time . bogie chose to stay in los angeles and spend it with his son . ` he was somewhat jealous of frank ' , bacall admitted . ` partly because he knew i loved being with him , partly because he thought frank was in love with me , and partly because our physical life together , which had always ranked high , had less than flourished with his illness ' . ` this was the closest bacall ever came to admitting her passion for frank during the time that her husband was dying , ' writes kelley . ` it was no secret to any of us ' , said playwright ketti frings . ` everybody knew about betty and frank . we just hoped bogie would n't find out . that would have been more killing than throat cancer ' . when bogart died in january 1957 , frank was performing at the copa nightclub in new york . he cancelled his appearances but did not fly to the west coast for the funeral of the man he had adored . ` he pleaded laryngitis , but close friends suspected that he had developed a crippling case of ` the guilt germs ' . soon their love affair was out in the open and betty and frank were seen about town , at premieres , dinner parties and weekends in palm springs . smooth sailing : until bogart was diagnosed with lung cancer in february 1956 the couple were deliriously happy . bacall admitted that they had a great sex life until he got sick . mistress : verita bouvair thompson , who traveled with bogart as his personal secretary , bartender and hairdresser , held two of bogie 's secrets - he wore a toupee . she was his mistress for seventeen years and wrote about their love story in her 1982 book bogie and me . ` it seemed to everyone -- to his friends , to mine -- that we were crazy about each other , that we were a great pair ; that it would n't last ; that frank would never be able to remain constantly devoted , monogamous -- yet that maybe with me , he would ' , betty said . what followed was months of an ` erratic ' courtship with frank - wildly attentive one minute and distant the next . he did n't want any woman telling him what to do and bacall admitted she was n't one to mildly suggest anything . she was deeply in love with the crooner and wanted to marry him . on the evening of march 11 , 1958 , fourteen months after her husband 's death , frank proposed . they celebrated by going to the imperial gardens restaurant on sunset boulevard with agent and friend , swifty lazar . when a young girl approached the table asking for autographs , sinatra urged her to sign ` betty sinatra ' . he was off to a gig in miami the next day and bacall went to the theatre with lazar where a newspaper columnist asked her about an impending marriage . she admitted the truth and by the next morning , the world knew when the morning paper 's early edition headlines read : sinatra to marry bacall . that was the death knell for the relationship . sinatra was livid when she phoned him in miami . when he finally returned her call days later , he said he was besieged with reporters and could n't leave his hotel room . that was the last time bacall heard from sinatra . ` he did n't speak to her again for six years , and then only in rage ' . when asked about the marriage , his only reply was ` marriage ? what for ? just so i 'd have to go home earlier every night ? nuts ! ' when actress ava gardner , sinatra 's first wife , called him from spain , he told her , ` jesus . i was never going to marry that pushy female ' . bacall 's response to the too-brief engagement was to call him ` a s *** ' and suggest she was so insecure at the time it was pathetic . for years , bacall never escaped the perception of the great love affair between her and humphrey bogart even when she married her second husband , jason robards . bust up : when betty spilled the beans that the crooner had proposed to a newspaper and it splashed a headline on the front page , sinatra was incensed . they split soon after and frank did n't speak to bacall for six years . she also never escaped the revelation that bogart had a mistress throughout their marriage . verita bouvair thompson , who traveled with bogart as his personal secretary , bartender and hairdresser , held two of bogie 's secrets -- he wore a toupee and she was his mistress for seventeen years . the mexican starlet met bogart at an after party for casablanca in 1942 , two years before he met bacall . thompson had established herself in hollywood as an expert on toupees , preparing hairpieces for george raft , ray milland and gary cooper -- as well as bogart . bogie did n't like to dance , but honey , we danced the night away and from that day on we were lovers ' , she stated . ` it 's hard for people to accept that bogie and bacall myth was n't really what it was ' , according to dean shapiro , a writer and thompson 's boyfriend . ` they were supposed to be this great hollywood couple , but bogie was carrying on with verita on the side . they did a lot of crazy things together ' . bacall had a secret of her own when she came to hollywood . she was a nice jewish girl but concealed it . ` there was anti-semitism in hollywood and i was terribly frightened . i was nineteen and was n't exactly swimming in self confidence . it 's one area of my life i am not proud of ' . when she fell in love with bogart , she made sure he knew but then he was the last man on earth who would have cared . bacall lived her life out at a luxurious , cavernous apartment on a high floor of the dakota , the grand residential building overlooking central park on manhattan 's upper west side where john lennon was living when he was shot down by david chapman in 1980 . she often ventured out always wearing all black , a black shirt , black pants and black orthopedic shoes -- always accompanied by her ` friend ' , her aluminum walker with tennis balls on its feet.still outspoken and feisty in her final years . after bacall 's marriage to jason robards broke down because of his drinking , she was linked with james garner , the ruggedly handsome star of rockford files , during his second separation from his wife in 1979 . garner died just a month before bacall .	 lauren bacall , humphrey bogart and frank sinatra were close pals , part of the ` holmby hills rat pack '   bacall knew bogie was jealous of frank , ` partly because he knew i loved being with him , partly because .   he thought frank was in love with me '   they began an affair when bogie was stricken with cancer , and ` came out ' as a couple after he died .   ` it seemed to everyone that we were crazy about each other ... that it would n't last ; that frank would never be able to be ... monogamous '   frank proposed at a restaurant on sunset boulevard , then dumped her like a hot potato .

134	the piano man was once on top , finding glory and fortune as one of the top-selling songwriters worldwide . in luck and love , the entertainer has suffered for the longest time , and over three marriages billy joel let a lot slip through his fingers thanks to depression and drink . a new biography comes out this week that , according to page six , involved 100 hours of interviews by writer fred schruers before joel exited the project . scroll down for video . tops : billy joel , who has sold more than 150 million records worldwide , found his love life and career dogged by drinking and depression . in ` billy joel : the definitive biography , ' the singer lays bare his history of suicide attempts , his tumultuous marriages -- including one to supermodel christie brinkley -- and how he 's now trying to keep his life together . joel met his first wife , elizabeth weber , in 1970 and was smitten from the start . ` she was n't like a lot of the other girls i knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes , ' he recounted . ` she was intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind , but could also be seductive . ' joel began a relationship with her , in spite of the fact that weber was married to jon small , the drummer of joel 's short-lived duo attila , with whom she had a young son named sean . when small uncovered the infidelity , weber split , leaving both him and joel . while her husband was left alone , it was joel who took her disappearance the hardest . one day , joel took a fatal dose of the anesthetic nembutal and phoned small to apologize . ` the next thing i remember , i woke up in the hospital and learned that they had pumped my stomach , ' he told schruers . rough waters : joel said in the book that he fell in love when he first met elizabeth weber , who cheated on her husband jon small , with joel , before leaving both . it was small who saved joel 's life , rushing to joel 's mother 's long island home , finding joel lying on the floor and getting him medical attention . another suicide attempt ended with joel checking into a mental health center , where he found himself surrounded by others who were not as lucky . ` the people i was locked up with were never going to be able to overcome their problems , whereas mine were all self-made . i can fix this , i thought . ' weber returned , to joel this time , not small , and began to manage the songwriter 's career , which began to take off even as he medicated his depression with a steady stream of alcohol . though friends found weber controlling and brusque , joel was enchanted , writing singles such as ` she 's got a way ' and ` she 's always a woman ' for her . joel describes the relationship now as a transaction . he says when he debuted ` just the way you are ' for her on her birthday , she asked him deadpan ` do i get the publishing , too ? ' inspiration : weber inspired three singles , but christie brinkley , who joel married in 1985 inspired all of an innocent man . beauty : brinkley had been featured on three back-to-back sports illustrated swimsuit edition covers when she met joel in st bart 's and went on to star in a number of his music videos . the relationship entangled weber 's brother frank in the finances as well , and years after she and joel finally divorced , the songwriter found frank had siphoned $ 30million out of his fortune . ' i hooked up with the borgias ! ' said joel . ` what a family to pick . ' shortly after things ended with weber in 1982 , joel was vacationing and met his second wife during an unreal encounter on the caribbean island of saint bart 's . sitting down at a piano , joel caught the attention of elle macpherson and then-unknown whitney houston . tagging along was their companion , christie brinkley . joel later later said ' i kind of felt like a teenager all over again ' when he returned to new york and started dating both brinkley and macpherson , the latter actually was a teenager when he met her . brinkley was asked to star in the music video for uptown girl , leading to the pair growing closer together . in 1985 , brinkley and joel married and he dedicated the album an ` an innocent man ' to her , though the declaration proved to be questionable in later years of their relationship . third time : joel reportedly picked up katie lee in a hotel lobby when she was a college student , before the two married in 2004 . striking : joel said he took lee to a performance of his own musical during one of their first dates , though she did n't know who the fading songwriting star was then . touring constantly to make up for his past financial struggles , joel became worn down by a life on the road and strained the marriage . one night in 1993 , after a concert at nassau coliseum , rather than go home to brinkley , joel booked a hotel . a band member told brinkley that joel was unfaithful that night , a claim joel denies but one that led to his eventual split with her . ` christie likes to joke that the end of the marriage spelled the end of my songwriting career , ' joel said , but it became a reality , as the next two decades saw him write and record very little . instead , he drank and spiraled into depression . he had three car accidents between 2002 and 2004 , which he once blamed on 911 and denied the involvement of alcohol . his romantic partner at the time was katie lee , who was in college when he flirted with her in the lobby of the peninsula hotel . according to an interview in the new york times , one of their first nights out was to joel 's own broadway musical , movin ' out . the two married in 2004 , when lee was 23 and joel was 55 , moving into a $ 4million penthouse in tribeca together . while the relationship did n't spur joel to new songwriting endeavors as it had with his past two wives , but it did eventually unravel just the same . joel was in and out of rehab , but at lee 's insistence went back on tour , often playing shows with elton john . lee herself became a fixture in the art scene . one day joel saw a photo of her dancing with another man at a gallery showing at art basel miami , though she rebuffs any accusations of an affair . joel could not handle his jealousy , and lee seemed uninterested in couples counseling that he suggested . ' i realized , it 's not going to happen , ' joel said , and told her ` we 're over . just do n't send me messages , do n't leave me cute little phone calls , do n't tease me , do n't f -- with me , just end it . ' ` i 'm an old man now , a vulnerable man . do n't do that to an old guy . ' the pair divorced in 2009 . it now seems the man once described by music critic robert christgau as a ` force of nature and bad taste ' has cut back on his time in the spotlight . though he released an album of classical compositions in 2001 and in spite of still touring arenas , joel has n't released studio music for a solid two decades . his drinking and depression have still not been resolved , at least according to the man himself , who in spite of numerous trips to rehab says he still has the occasional drink . he 's somewhat humbled from his days of dating supermodels , and is living with a girlfriend , 33 and a former hedge fund manager , but he says he remains a romantic . ` you can have all the money in the world , you can have mansions , you can have properties , you can have yachts , you can have limousines , you can have motorcycles , ' he told schruers . if you do n't have love , ` it does n't mean a goddamn thing . '	 a new book , billy joel : the definitive biography , written by fred schruers , lays out the songwriter 's rise to fame and gives details of his crushing lows .   his first marriage to elizabeth weber inspired a number of singles , but ended with the songwriter being fleeced by his brother-in-law for millions .   he married supermodel christie brinkley in 1985 after courting her and elle macpherson at the same time .   brinkley inspired the album an innocent man .   an alleged infidelity led to their divorce , before joel married katie lee in 2004 .   drinking was rumored to be a factor in several car accidents from 2002 to 2004 , though joel later blamed depression caused by 911 .

146	mike catt is just the man to evaluate the hype around jonathan joseph and the comparisons being made with jeremy guscott , as the long span of his career meant he played with both centres . after england 's man of the moment touched down twice at twickenham on saturday , following a try-scoring contribution to the victory in cardiff , the ` new guscott ' tag was being applied with more conviction than ever . catt , the national team 's attacking skills coach , worked with joseph during his transition from playing to coaching at london irish , so he has been aware of his potential for several years . jonathan joseph scored two tries for england against italy and has earned comparisons with jeremy guscott . mike catt -lrb- left -rrb- played with guscott and now works with joseph due to his england coaching role . guscott -lrb- left -rrb- charges through ireland 's defence to score a try for england at twickenham . asked about the comparisons with his former bath and england accomplice , catt said : ` i made them four years ago but he 's a different player . jerry was more of a swerving outside centre , when there 's a big hole in the 13 channel . ` there are n't many holes any more , so jj 's footwork and his ability to slip out of tackles , like you saw -lrb- on saturday -rrb- and last week , is phenomenal . that 's the x factor you need to win games . you know you need the x factor like that to be able to break defences down . ` but jerry got 70-odd caps so we 'll see how many jj gets . he 's got a lot more tries to get , to be fair to guscott . but three from eight caps is not bad . it 's brilliant to see , it 's refreshing . ' there were many satisfying aspects of england 's six-try demolition of italy which maintained the fine start to their rbs 6 nations crusade and a few glaring problems to address . but as the capacity crowd dispersed there was no doubt about the primary subject for excited discussion . joseph is creating a buzz . he has been the form centre in the country this season and now his stellar form has transferred seamlessly to the test arena . his tries on saturday came after he had been shunted out to the wing as part of a reshuffle caused by the early loss of mike brown . the 23-year-old 's first try , from turnover ball near halfway , featured a glorious side-step and a turbo-charged burst clear of the covering defenders . his second strike was expertly crafted by george ford 's delayed pass to send him hurtling through a gap . joseph -lrb- lower -rrb- crossed the line twice for england against italy and has three tries in eight appearances . jospeh -lrb- centre -rrb- celebrates with luther burrell -lrb- left -rrb- in england 's six nations victory against italy . england attacking skills coach catt -lrb- left -rrb- was a world cup winner in the 2003 tournament in australia . catt is delighted to see confirmation of the promise he saw years ago as joseph shows there is a place in the modern international game for subtle attacking qualities amid the thunder of heavy cavalry . ` everybody thinks international rugby is all about size but players who play against jonathan joseph do n't want to defend him because he 's lethal , ' he said . ` he 's a hard man to stop . he has incredible feet . ` he 's very hard to break down if you get the ball to him early , and that 's where george -lrb- ford -rrb- has been phenomenal . george gives him early ball and then he 's able to see what 's in front of him . he just plants guys down and gets round them . he 's never tackled behind the gain line . he always makes an extra two or three metres and that 's crucial when it comes to attack , especially in the 13 channel . ' joseph 's exploits from the flank against italy will give the england coaches cause to consider him as a wing option if they ever have their full midfield contingent fit . but he is making a powerful case for a long run in his preferred position at outside centre . the no 13 shirt was seemingly only made to measure for manu tuilagi but the leicester wrecking ball faces a battle to regain his place when he returns from injury . ` going into a world cup you 've got to have four centres , ' said catt , a member of the victorious 2003 england team . ` having guys like manu who can break down a defence in a different way to how jj does is what you want . you 've got a good balance there -- and competition . ` for manu to get his place back you 're going to have to see some fireworks . let 's see how it carries on going . it 's just great to have a consistency again between a centre partnership . we 'll see how they develop . i 'm sure they will . ' catt said there will have to be ` fireworks ' from manu tuilagi -lrb- centre -rrb- to regain his place in the england side . catt also praised the impressive performances of george ford in england 's six nations campaign so far . england coach stuart lancaster will want to see his side combat the sluggish start made against italy . england were far too strong for italy but lancaster 's tempered reaction to the victory told its own tale of shortcomings which must be addressed . a repeat of saturday 's sluggish start will be far harder to recover from against ireland in dublin in 13 days ' time when the championship 's two unbeaten teams collide . of the six english tries , the first by billy vunipola owed much to a generous interpretation of the footage by the tmo . joseph 's finishes were sublime , while ben youngs was alert enough to pounce with a quick tap penalty from close range when the visitors ' defence had switched off . the other scorers were the recalled danny cipriani and nick easter , which went some way to justifying their return to the test fold . captain chris robshaw had a titanic influence as usual -- topping the tackle charts as always with 18 , while his harlequins skipper joe marler built on his superb autumn campaign with another imposing display . in the second row , george kruis again belied his inexperience with a forceful contribution and no 8 vunipola ran amok as the game wore on . england captain chris robshaw -lrb- right -rrb- made the most tackles in the game with italy and had a huge influence . danny cipriani -lrb- right -rrb- scored a try against italy to help justify his return to the england test fold . jonny may -lrb- second left -rrb- created cipriani 's try but also squandered a three-on-one overlap in the first half . but lancaster was rightly concerned by a dip in defensive intensity which allowed the italians to score three tries . in attacking terms , jonny may created cipriani 's try but lacked composure when he squandered a three-on-one overlap just before half-time . such fundamental lapses are not critical in a one-sided encounter but they could be fatal in a world cup knock-out match . still , clear room for improvement from a winning position is probably the management 's ultimate scenario at this juncture .	 jonathan joseph crossed the line twice in england 's 47-17 win over italy .   his six nations performances have drawn comparisons to jeremy guscott .   but england coach mike catt believes joseph possesses different skills . 
147	england prop david wilson has been ruled out of the rbs 6 nations tournament due to a neck injury , coach stuart lancaster has announced . the 29-year-old bath tighthead will miss england 's remaining four fixtures and will be sidelined for up to three months . wilson will , however , be back in time for the world cup training camp . david wilson has been ruled out of the six nations with a neck injury , stuart lancaster has confirmed . the bath prop missed the opening win against wales at the millennium stadium last week . ` david has seen the specialist and will be out for the six nations , ' lancaster said . ` he 's booked in for an operation tomorrow that will relieve his nerve impingement . he 'll be out for 10-12 weeks . ' wilson missed england 's tournament opener against wales - a 21-16 victory at the millennium stadium - due to the injury . the nerve problem is similar to the one that has ruled lock joe launchbury out of the entire competition . england have been hit with a host of injuries ahead of the six nations , with wilson the ninth member of the squad to suffer a problem leading to a lay-off . dan cole replaced wilson against wales on friday night and the tighthead impressed . england have been plagued by injuries this year , with henry launchbury also out with a similar injury . while centre brad barritt and second row geoff parling could both return at some point during the series after both suffering knee ligament injuries , six others have either been ruled out or do not have an expected return date . fly-half owen farrell suffered a left knee ligament injury during saracens ' european champions cup defeat at clermont and is out of the entire six nations while number eight ben morgan had ankle surgery after being carried off against saracens last month and is also out , along with launchberry . powerful centre manu tuilagi is unavailable due to a chronic groin condition he first suffered in october while kyle eastmond aggravated a shoulder in the final weekend of european club action and no date has been set for his return . finally , northampton flanker tom wood injured his ankle against racing metro and while he did not require surgery , it is unknown when he will return .	 david wilson missed england 's opening six nations victory against wales .   the bath tighthead now ruled out for remainder of tournament .   dan cole replaced wilson in cardiff , who should be fit for the world cup .   henry launchbury also out with a similar problem .

156	when opportunity knocked les ferdinand paid attention . from non-league southall to the england team and most recently to a desk in his office behind which he sits in his designer knitwear while queens park rangers train . he 'd rather be out on the grass , he explains , but this interview is keeping him indoors and , when the director of football picks a route through the mud to pose for a photograph , the temptation for some is too much to resist . ` f *** ing hell les , we 've only won one game , ' yells joey barton , from the midst of a nearby finishing drill , his verbal arrows more accurate than anything from his feet , as usual . les ferdinand believes english kids are made to look mediocre but he thinks they just need an opportunity . the former england international wants to bring the stan bowles spirit back to loftus road . the other players titter and ferdinand laughs along . the mood is relaxed ahead of saturday 's game at hull city where chris ramsey tries to build on victory at sunderland , the first away points of a difficult campaign , before they fly to dubai for a training break . ` in a short space of time , there 's been a positive turn , ' smiles ferdinand . ` the reaction has been great . we want to be a premier league side . we know the figures . we also know the first year up is the hardest . our focus is on staying in this division and everyone to a man is confident of doing it . ' survival is vital with financial fair play penalties hanging over qpr if they slide into the football league and a large part of ferdinand 's role is to set down principles to keep the club within its means based around growing their own players . ferdinand says qpr 's premier league survival is vital for the club and he 's confident they can do just that . ferdinand explains : ` in this country , we 'll buy someone from abroad for # 20m who has been playing professional football for years and we all go : ` give him a year to 18 months to settle in ' . ` yet we 'll take someone out of the development squad who has never played any senior football in his life and if he 's not a world-beater within two games everyone 's saying : ` well , he 's no good is he ' . ` why not afford the kid the same opportunity ? it 's incredible . we 're making english players and english coaches appear mediocre and they 're not . they 're more than that , given the opportunity . ' he speaks from experience and with qpr in his blood . hayes signed him from nearby southall for # 5,000 and sold him a few months later to queen 's park rangers for an initial # 15,000 , plus another # 15,000 based on appearances and a 10 per cent sell-on which turned out to be # 600,000 . born in paddington and raised in ladbroke grove , he walked by loftus road every day on his way to christopher wren school , now phoenix high school in shepherd 's bush . ferdinand signed for qpr from non-league hayes and established himself as one of the best in the league . the former england international thinks youngsters should be allowed to settle like the foreign imports . ' i was n't a qpr fan but they were the only team i saw play live when i was a kid , ' said ferdinand . ` my cousin 's husband brought me to a game against leicester when i was 11 and phil parkes saved a penalty . ` the thing i was most impressed about was that he played in goal with bare hands . i stood behind the goal thinking : ` woah , this geezer 's got no gloves on , man ' and i ended up playing in goal at school for three years because of that . ` with players like stan bowles and rodney marsh , they were always associated with entertaining football . terry venables went in and got them promoted and the plastic pitch was in full swing when i joined . there was none of this 3g and 4g , there were no ` g 's involved at all . ' the former england striker revealed he used to play in goal as a youngster after watching phil parkes . he lost 4-1 at coventry , but cyrille regis left a big impression . ` he 'd come from non-league like me , ' said ferdinand . ` he looked so massive and strong and had this aura . i was thinking : how do i get to that ? ' his second appearance was worse -- a 7-1 defeat at sheffield wednesday -- before he returned from a year on loan at besiktas to established himself in a team managed by gerry francis . they were the top london club in 1993 , finishing fifth in the inaugural premier league . ` qpr went out and bought well from the lower divisions and made players better , ' said ferdinand . ` players came through the ranks , like kevin gallen , bradley allen and danny dichio . people moaned that we sold our best players , but we could n't compete for multi-million pound players . ' i came when it was acceptable for qpr to go and spend # 30,000 on a non-league player but clubs have stopped doing it . the demands are such that if you 're not spending # 10million on players in every transfer window , you 're not competing and lack ambition . his goalscoring record at qpr was impressive after 80 goals in just 163 appearances for the london club . newcastle united signed him from qpr for # 6million and he was extremely prolific at st james ' park . ` it 's about educating . we were n't buying players for # 3million back then . we were selling for that money and for a club like qpr this has to be the avenue . ' years of boardroom instability and managerial chaos seem to have left the club with an identity crisis which ferdinand will address with the backing of owner tony fernandes . ' i will look at the long-term future of the club , ' said the director of football . ` and we will make sure it works . my job is not to sign players . it 's to work with all areas of management to improve the club . ' at the heart is youth development and opening pathways to the first-team . ` i 'm not saying our first-team is going to be full of 21-year-olds , ' he said . ` you need experienced heads . when i came here i had the likes of ray wilkins and nigel spackman to help me . gerry francis and ferdinand after his move to tottenham hotspur from newcastle in 1998 . ` but we need to attract youngsters here by giving them the opportunity in the first-team . that has to be our selling point . with respect , if you go to chelsea and some of the bigger clubs , you 're not getting a chance to play in the first-team unless you 're the most exceptional of the exceptional . ' ferdinand and ramsey were previously employed at tottenham as part of a coaching team responsible for nurturing harry kane , andros townsend , ryan mason and nabil bentaleb . ` all of a sudden the conveyer belt has started , ' he said , and the desire to strengthen the same spurs connection at loftus road prompted ferdinand to recommend tim sherwood for the job when harry redknapp quit . tim sherwood -lrb- centre -rrb- was recommended for the hoops post by ferdinand , but he opted for aston villa . ` it is my remit is to bring people in who will progress the club , ' said ferdinand . ` we 'd done well at tottenham and i know what he does . we 're good friends but i ca n't afford to bring someone in here because he 's my mate . ` he 's a very good manager but he opted for villa before we really had a chance to sit down and talk and the way things happened we had to act quickly . anyone coming in from outside was going to be a gamble . ` and , as the owner has said , the job is chris 's to lose . i know what he 's capable of . he 's been doing it forever , but he 's never had the opportunity . ' this is chris ramsey 's first managerial position and has the tough task of saving qpr from relegation .	 les ferdinand wants the stan bowles spirit back to queens park rangers .   the former player is a firm believer in the development of english players .   the 48-year-old started his career at the bottom of the footballing pyramid .   the ex-hoops , newcastle and spurs star is determined to keep qpr up .   ferdinand recommended his ` good friend ' tim sherwood for the qpr job before he became the new boss of fellow strugglers aston villa .   click here for all the latest queens park rangers news .

'' ' he will be hoping to vent that frustration through his performance at the stade de france . including his three lions caps , north will become the most junior player to reach the 50-test mark , eclipsing australia 's joe roff , who reached the milestone when he was 24 . a special pair of boots have been commissioned for the occasion and north intends to hang them on the wall alongside those from his first test in 2010 . ` for me it was never a case of 50 or 100 caps , ' said north . ` it was always about being in that jersey once , then anything more is a bonus . north has had a special pair of boots commissioned for north 's 50th cap in paris against the french . the adidas boots include the branding ' # 50 - 28/02/2015 ' , marking the number of caps and the date . ` i 'm obviously super-proud to achieve it and hopefully i can keep my head down and get to my welsh 50 . i kept my first-cap boots , my lions boots and i 'll probably keep these boots as well . you keep your jerseys , too -- hopefully my mum has n't thrown any of them out ! ' his mother will be among the crowd in paris to watch her son . the 17st 2lb speedster has a promising record against les bleus -- two tries in his two previous appearances -- but is not expecting a repeat of 2013 , when his father earned himself cult status by running on to the pitch to celebrate north 's 71st-minute try . ` i 've ordered tickets for my family but my old man is up the top , ' joked north . ` my mam and sister are at the front but my dad is in the top right-hand corner . if i score and he manages to get down from there , i 'll be impressed ! ' north shares a laugh with his wing partner liam williams -lrb- left -rrb- during wales training ahead of the game . with or without his father , north will certainly celebrate if he crosses the whitewash . having scored just one try in his last six wales appearances , the national coaches are demanding more from the former scarlet . his club form is much better -- 11 tries in 15 appearances this season -- and gatland has told the wideman that he must look for more touches on the ball . ` it 's obvious to see , ' said north . ` i 've been very happy with my club form over the past few weeks but i 've just not been able to get into my groove for my country . ` the england game was a step forward from the autumn series and the summer tour for me . i missed the scotland game but hopefully this will be the next step back on to that track .

' while some artists may look at digital painting as ` cheating ' -- after all , you can delete mistaken brush strokes -- hall , who lives in britain , thinks it actually makes artists more daring . ` if you spent 50 pounds -lrb- $ 75 -rrb- on canvas and another 50 pounds on paint , at some point you are going to get careful . you do n't want to waste what you spent , ' he says . for apple 's display , hall used procreate to paint portraits of people he encountered at the university where he lectures . alistair taylor-young took photos of rainy cityscapes from behind a sheet of glasswith the iphone 6 for apple 's project . ` crystal mosaic ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective . chad riley used the burst mode funtion of the ipad air 2 to capture the swimmer . they include a bearded , mustached young man with bright yellow glasses and an intense stare , and a woman in a floppy black hat lost in thought . alistair taylor-young , whose photography career spans two decades and has shot for fashion icons such as armani and fendi and magazines ranging from conde nast traveler to french vogue , took photos of rainy cityscapes with the iphone 6 for apple 's project . ` crystal mosaic ' uses the phone 's own camera app to bring drops of rain on glass into focus , showing ordinary scenes through a different perspective . jingyao guo used idraw on an imac to create this image of chinese new year . she also used the photo booth app to capture her own facial expressions , which were then transposed onto the figures in the artwork . taylor-young bought an iphone in 2007 , when they first came out . having worked with polaroid cameras early in his career , he found the quality of the original iphone 's camera very similar . ` it was quite soft and the colors were muted and distorted , ' he says . ` the moment i picked up the phone and started taking pictures , it reminded me of photography in its infancy . ` you could n't focus , change exposure . ` you just saw something and took a photo .

163	the conca d'oro - the golden basin - sounds like something hidden and precious . it is . this is a part of tuscany , deep in the chianti region , that not even tuscany insiders know about . it 's a place you might stumble across , if you were lost . i should know . although it 's only a 60-mile drive from pisa , i got lost and did not have a sat-nav , so it was well after midnight before i finally collapsed in my bed in the villa barone . the villa barone is just outside the village of panzano ; and panzano is where you head to discover the conca d'oro . a hilltop haven : the little village of panzano neatly encapsulates the beauty of the region . after breakfast , we strolled into the village . below , the gentle hills and valleys of the conca dozed away the summer . the bakery and cafe were doing steady business . panzano has a population of 979 , not many of whom were in evidence . a couple of older citizens sat on a bench and discussed life . there was not much traffic other than the occasional farmer 's van or another visibly lost hire car . but in the distance there was a sound that was distinctly at odds with these tranquil , timeless surroundings . we walked towards the cacophony . here , in the land of cantatas and madrigals , someone was playing the aussie rockers ac/dc at full blast - in a butcher 's shop . people , some of them with wine glasses in hand , were spilling onto the pavement . inside , the place was packed with a crowd laughing and drinking . it was not like any other butcher 's shop i 'd ever known . but then it belongs to dario cecchini : possibly the world 's only celebrity butcher . fragrantly fertile : the fields and slopes of chianti swarm with vineyards . dario looks a bit like jack nicholson 's jovial italian cousin . he has demonic eyebrows , a large , hooked nose and burly frame . all the international superstar chefs know him : alice waters , wolfgang puck , jamie oliver . his shop is a place of pilgrimage for those who care about meat . it is also a restaurant . at lunch , under the vines and on long tables , we ate course after course of his succulent beef . there were glasses of majestic fontodi reds . and the best guide to the conca d'oro is the man who makes that wine : giovanni manetti . if dario is a tuscan jack nicholson , giovanni is an italian cary grant : tanned , beautifully dressed , dryly humorous . after lunch , he drove us around his 80-hectare estate . so what is the conca ? sculpted into the hills 2,000 ft high , it 's a fertile valley once famous for its golden corn - hence the name . today , the corn has gone and the conca is a kind of heaven for wine-growers and cheese-makers , as well as butchers , english chefs and ac/dc fans . the south-facing slopes are perfect for giovanni 's wonderful organic wines . his vines are interspersed with barley to feed his chianina cows . their manure nourishes the vines , their milk makes the cheese and their meat ends up in dario 's big hands . later that evening , dario was cranking up the volume and sharpening the knives . the coals in his inferno were white hot and highway to hell blasted out of the speakers . here in foodie heaven it was going to be a long and hellishly good night . british . airways -lrb- 0844 493 0787 ; www.ba.com -rrb- flies to pisa from gatwick from # 86 . return . double rooms at villa barone -lrb- www.villalebarone.com -rrb- cost from $ 195 a . night .	 the conca d'oro - the golden basin - is one of tuscany 's less-known areas .   small , idyllic villages such as panzano are the order of the day in the area .   the town is also home to the butcher every celebrity chef has on speed dial .

165	the owner of a hotel in scotland has turned to social media in the hope of tracking down a young couple who , he claims , left after a luxury valentine 's weekend without paying their bill . hotelier jason henderson took to facebook to allege that the couple racked up a tab of # 800 then left suddenly in a silver audi . henderson is offering a two-night stay at the four-star knock castle hotel and spa in crieff , perthshire , to anyone who can help him find the pair using a cctv image he has shared online . the young couple were captured on cctv before disappearing , allegedly , without paying for their bill . the mystery couple reportedly splashed out on fine food , flowers and wine - leading to a hefty # 800 bill . however , the furious hotel owner alleges they left early without settling up with the front desk . speaking exclusively to mailonline travel , knock castle owner jason henderson said : ` it 's disappointing and very upsetting that this has happened , myself and all the staff work so hard to sustain the business . ` to me it 's not about the # 750 , # 800 , it 's about highlighting what these people have done and making sure they do n't do it again . it 's a matter of principle . ` all we expect is people to pay their way , and i would n't like this to happen to anyone , whether they are our rivals in the market or not . ' i have been blown away by the support i have received by people who are all trying to help since i posted on facebook ; it 's really pleasing . ` the police here are very effective , and i 'm quite confident they will catch the two . ' henderson , who has been running the hotel for seven years and takes on the roles of head chef , general manager and owner , revealed that the couple had enjoyed meals , snacks , champagne and flowers during a three-night stay . he also believes the couple were ` from scotland ' and that they used fake id when checking in . the 4-star knock castle hotel & spa , where a case of fraud is being investigated by police after a couple allegedly fled without paying . hotelier jason henderson has offered a free two night stay for anyone who can id the couple . the facebook post by knock castle claims the couple used ` false ' credit card details , leaving it unable to trace the mystery guests . it also claims the couple were driving a silver audi a3 and posted a cctv image of them on the property . the woman has long dark hair and is wearing a pink jumper and jeans , while the man appears to be blonde and is wearing a blue zip up jacket and jeans . police scotland have confirmed to mailonline travel that the matter is being investigated . a spokesperson said : ` we can confirm we are looking into a report of fraud at knock castle hotel and spa in crieff . ` the incident occurred between 6.30 pm and 9am on february 13/14 . ` the man is about 5ft 6ins , of thin build , aged in his late 20s and was wearing a blue jacket . the woman is approximately 5ft 8ins and of medium build . ` anyone who has any information are urged to call police scotland on 101 .

166	it 's hot or not time again as ian ladyman reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside . what 's hot . nigel clough . on receiving a letter of complaint from a derby county supporter , clough , the club 's manager , drove round to his house . nigel clough has guided league one sheffield united to the semi-finals of the capital one cup . later that year he received correspondence from another fan suggesting his 18-year-old son could get in his team . clough invited the lad to training and threw him a pair of boots . lovely tales , both , but they do more than suggest clough jnr has a flick of his old man about him . they tell you that clough knows his mind and this is something evident in the way he selects his very best team for cup matches . hired last season to keep united in league one , he did that but i would imagine his club 's fans will treasure the memory of the fa cup semi-final that followed rather more . a year on and clough 's team have a sniff of wembley again . united 's league form may suffer if they do make it to the capital one cup final but clough will take the risk . football is supposed to be about guts and glory . nobody writes letters to football managers to thank them for finishing eighth do they ? clough 's sheffield united go into the second leg against tottenham at bramall lane a goal down . mike brearley . the australian quick dennis lillee used to tell toiling batsman : ` you 've got some s ** t on the end of your bat ' . on seeing the more gullible flip the bat over and examine the bottom , lillee would add : ` wrong end mate ' . it was crude but it was funny . what was only one of these things was michael clarke 's welcome to jimmy anderson when the englishman arrived at the crease in brisbane last winter . ` get ready for a broken f ***** g arm , ' grunted the australian captain . dennis lillee of australia and pakistan 's javed miandad clash during a test match back in 1981 . david warner and rohit sharma exchange words during australia 's clash with india in melbourne . the aussies are n't the only exponents of what the modern cricketer ludicrously calls ` mental disintegration ' . typically , they 're just better at it than everybody else . the point is , though , that it 's not amusing and there is too much of it . the current interpretation of sledging is one step removed from bar room name calling and before long there will be a fight on a first class cricket pitch . former england captain brearley -- now chairman of the icc 's world cricket committee -- has asked for the issue to be on the agenda of next week 's meeting and he is quite right to do so . former england cricket captain mike brearley , picutred in 1981 , has called to stamp out sledging . raheem sterling . when you can really play , you can play just about anywhere . back from a break in the caribbean , sterling must have wished he was back in his hammock when manager brendan rodgers asked him to play centre forward against john terry and gary cahill on tuesday night . at times during the first half , the little liverpool forward looked as likely to score as mario balotelli , who was n't even at the ground . sterling , though , has football intelligence and , like all the good players , he found a way to get it done . his dash towards goal from deep for liverpool 's equaliser resembled a rugby scrum-half spotting a gap from the 20-metre line and was the work of a quick mind . all that roy hodgson nonsense about sterling complaining about tiredness in october sounds like background noise now and it should have been treated as such at the time . raheem sterling shoots past chelsea 's gary cahill -lrb- centre -rrb- and thibaut courtois -lrb- right -rrb- to score for liverpool . what 's not . everton . like the day tiger woods drove his car in to a fire hydrant outside his house , sometimes it 's not the incident that ultimately transpires to be important but what it reveals . so it is with the curious case of kevin mirallas and the stolen penalty kick . kevin mirallas missed a penalty as everton drew 0-0 against west brom at goodison park on monday . mirallas -lrb- second left -rrb- demanded to take the penalty despite leighton baines -lrb- left -rrb- being everton 's regular taker . three questions : where was captain phil jagielka when mirallas decided to shove leighton baines to the back of the queue ? why did baines give way so meekly ? why , in essence , did mirallas feel so confident he could get away with his act of impertinence in the first place ? these are the issues that make everton look as though they have gone soft under roberto martinez . a couple of weeks ago , jagielka gave newspaper interviews claiming media stories about shouting matches in the dressing room were so false they made him laugh . one final question : everton are four points from the relegation zone . if nobody is shouting , why not ? the belgian dragged his penalty wide of ben foster 's goal as the game remained goalless just before half-time . mirallas watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of foster . ruud gullit . the clip in which manchester united manager louis van gaal appeared to refer to his opponents as ` queens park raisins ' should have been the stand out blooper on match of the day . however , he was eclipsed by one of the programme 's own as gullit provided an insight in to what can happen if you do n't pay attention . there was a beautiful arrogance about gullit 's football but that does n't work as an analyst and last weekend he appeared short on preparation . asked by host gary lineker about paul lambert , he started to talk about ricky lambert . one manages aston villa while the other is occasionally a centre forward for liverpool . later in the show , lineker commented : ` stoke in to the top half ' to which his guest replied : ` could be . ' stoke are , of course , already tenth . small details perhaps but it 's the small details that give a pundit the platform on which he can make broader and bolder statements with credibility . without these he is nothing . ruud gullit appeared short on preparation when the former ac milan player appeared on match of the day . martin kaymer . golf can make you so unhappy it 's no wonder those who depend on it to feed the kids find ways of pretending that the bad stuff was really quite good . this was kaymer after his final round in abu dhabi last weekend . ' i did n't hit many fairways and i did n't make many putts , ' said the german . ` on the other hand i was playing really good golf . ' martin kaymer was defeated by two over the course of 14 holes at abu dhabi last week . certainly kaymer 's collapse from ten shots clear to defeat by two over the course of 14 holes hints at much more bad than good but the really sad thing about his demise is that the bloke who actually won the thing -- world number 357 gary stal -- is already lost in the story . after all , who remembers the name of the horse who won the devon loch grand national in 1956 ? young stal should be celebrating the greatest day of his young life but the reality is that the 22-year-old is already on his way to becoming little more than an answer to a rather obscure quiz question . * the horse was called esb , by the way .	 raheem sterling scored for liverpool in the league cup against chelsea .   sheffield united manager nigel clough one game away from wembley .   kevin mirallas penalty incident highlights everton 's problems . 
167	dear west ham fans , . in my very first column of the season , i wrote that i feared for your team . i was worried that the inconsistencies of the previous campaign , the quality of the performances and the value of the summer signings meant you would flirt with relegation and i predicted you would finish fourth from bottom . after all the stick i got over the years at upton park i find it very hard to apologise to any west ham fan but , i am happy to admit just this once , that i was wrong about your team . hitting form : west ham 's run of four wins in february saved them from relegation . by sunday night west ham will still be in the premier league and comfortably clear of the relegation zone . i could not see that happening at the start of the season . the club and sam allardyce have proved me wrong . even though his imminent sacking may not come as a surprise , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty from the west ham board . what kind of message does it send to a prospective new manager when you ditch a man who has achieved everything asked of him ? at times the football has not been pretty but allardyce masterminded three big wins over tottenham and a crucial 0-0 draw at chelsea . that result sent west ham on a four-match winning streak -- their first in seven years -- and was the run that saved their season and kept them up . it is admirable allardyce got the chance to see things through , especially with other clubs sacking managers for fun -- the bottom three have had seven between them this season -- and he has managed in a bullish manner throughout . on his way : sam allardyce is understood to be nearing an exit from upton park . they have survived quite comfortably in the end , but there have been problems . andy carroll , who allardyce signed for record money , has scored only twice and his injury saga was a real concern . the away form has barely improved since last season , either . but sam is a troubleshooter , the kind of man clubs turn to for a quick fix . now west ham 's problem of survival has been solved , the fans and the club are ready for a change . allardyce will feel aggrieved he lost his job over the brand of football rather than results , but all is not lost . tony pulis was sacked by stoke in similar circumstances but has evolved and enhanced his reputation with crystal palace . if this is the end for sam , he can easily do the same thing at another top club . west ham fans are purists and want their team to play with flair , but we have not seen that for a few generations and any transition will not happen overnight . out ! west ham fans let their frustration out on the manager after defeat to west brom . the team are set up for matt jarvis and stewart downing to find carroll with crosses . the new boss will have to make the most of the players he has , making tweaks to the way they play rather having a radical overhaul . for all the desire to play more attractive football , sacking allardyce is a huge gamble . the club will want to be a premier league side when they move into the olympic stadium in 2016 and sam could have provided that stability . he achieved all that was asked and usually in business if you meet your objectives , you keep your job . but for west ham fans football is an entertainment business and they do not feel entertained . it is not a decision that will be taken lightly , but when allardyce was booed by his own fans , it was the beginning of the end . it was never an easy relationship but now it 's up to the board to find a new man who fits the bill . fresh new start : a new manager could drive west ham up the league next season . in the spotlight : yaya toure , age 30 , manchester city . he may not be the most original pick for spotlight but when yaya toure said he did not receive enough recognition earlier this season , i could not agree more . there is a lot of talk at the moment about the development of young english players but any youngster will only take inspiration from what toure is doing on and off the pitch . he is one of the most humble people i 've met in football , he is a team player first and foremost and his individual ability is unquestioned . underrated : yaya toure has not received the praise he deserves after another superb season . it is rare to find a player who so perfectly mixes pace , power and technique . he can finish like a forward and defend like a centre half , as he proved for barcelona in the 2009 champions league final . if city are struggling to score on sunday , it will probably be yaya who pops up with a winner . if he keeps it up i might say he is better than my old team-mate patrick vieira . but he 's still got some work to do to match the fantastic frenchman .	 the club and sam allardyce have proved me wrong , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty to sack sam allardyce .   by sunday night west ham will be comfortably clear from relegation .   the football has not always been pretty , but he masterminded huge wins .   yaya toure does not get the recognition he deserves in the premier league .

' but . following the end of prohibition in 1933 , as well as a sudden rise in . cases of sexually transmitted disease , montreal prostitutes lost their exotic . allure and were instead seen as a force of corruption that needed to be . stopped - publicly , at least . indeed , . while raids were frequent and arrests were many in the 1940s , fines . were low , and many prostitutes and brothel owners resumed business . shortly after their handcuffs were taken off . local madam : some addresses that were known to police as brothels were hit often . one such location was 1225 bullion , a brothel kept by fleurette dubois . in her mug shot , ms dubois slouches and stares at the camera disinterestedly , her deep red lips , dark curls and pencil-thin eyebrows on display . dual identity : not all these women were prostitutes or madams in the traditional sense ; one image is that of blanche martin , a servant who was arrested in may 1940 for owning a brothel . this was most likely another factor that contributed to the women 's seeming nonchalance in their mug shots . some . addresses that were known to police as brothels were hit often . one . such location was 1225 bullion , a brothel kept by fleurette dubois . in . her mug shot , ms dubois slouches and stares at the camera . disinterestedly , her deep red lips , dark curls and pencil-thin eyebrows . on display . in may 1942 , ruby taylor was also arrested at ms dubois ' brothel as part of a police investigation into prostitution . hers . is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating mug shots ; in it , she bares . her teeth in a knowing grin , the corners of her eyes crinkling with mild . amusement . ready for her close-up : ruby taylor , who was arrested in 1942 as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution , is the only woman to smile at the camera . perhaps her knowing look had to do with the fact that many of the officers who arrested the sex workers were crooked cops that were also clients . busted : gisèle roy , who had an alias of marie-jeanne lambert , was arrested for prostitution in 1941 . booming trade : marguerite smith was arrested several times between 1941 and 1943 for operating a brothel at 1225 bullion . arrested : like marguerite smith , madeleine gagnon was also stopped at 1223 bullion as part of an investigation in connection with prostitution . some of the . other women arrested in this era in relation to prostitution include . stern-looking brunette annie parker and mary shepperd - a youthful woman . with eyebrows drawn so far apart that they lend her an air of sadness . lina . tony was arrested in december 1941 for owning two brothels on the same . road . in her mug shot , dark bags under her eyes and a masculine , . disheveled haircut reveal the toll her profession has had on her . appearance . not all . these women were prostitutes or madams in the traditional sense ; one . image is that of blanche martin , a servant who was arrested in may 1940 . for owning a brothel . and jeanine lebrun , a maid , was arrested on april 11 , 1940 for keeping a . brothel , part of the city-wide effort to crack down on a booming . prostitution industry . sex trade : germaine giraud , who was arrested in connection with an investigation into prostitution . prostitution 's legality in montreal has always been a point of contention , but during world war ii , it was at its most prevalent . tough times : lina tony was arrested in december 1941 for owning two brothels on the same road . in her mug shot , dark bags under her eyes and a masculine , disheveled haircut reveal the toll her profession has had on her appearance . nonchalant : delicato bizante lucie , one of three main madams in montreal . while raids were frequent and arrests were many in the 1940s , fines were low , and many prostitutes and brothel owners resumed business shortly after they were handcuffed .	 montreal was the center for sex during prohibition in the u.s. , when americans would travel north to fulfil their illicit needs in canada .   the end of prohibition as well as a rise in sexually transmitted disease saw police enforcing a crackdown on the prostitution industry , during which time these women were put behind bars . 
176	` socialist ' : ed miliband , pictured , was accused of being a ` card carrying marxist ' by sir john ritblat . one of britain 's top businessmen has accused ed miliband of being a ` card carrying marxist ' who is ` unfit to govern ' . in the latest salvo from a captain of industry , sir john ritblat also accused the labour leader of ` learning nothing and forgetting everything ' from the financial crisis . sir john , who bought british land for # 1million in 1970 and transformed it into one of the uk 's biggest and most successful companies , voiced concerns that a labour government would ` pick up some of the flaws of the french economy ' . he said : ` i would simply say there is a problem when the leadership is obviously very inexperienced , has never been involved in commerce and whose family tradition is one of left wing , totally unreconstructed , card carrying marxists . this is not a good basis for pragmatic government . ' the 79-year-old city grandee , who was responsible for transforming the skyline of london with the development of the giant broadgate office complex in the heart of the city , added : ` this all adds to the impression that mr miliband is unfit to govern ' . last night one of britain 's leading fashion entrepreneurs harold tillman also joined the backlash against labour , accusing it of wanting to ` stamp on aspiration . ' arguing mr miliband warrants his ` red ed ' nickname , mr tillman - who previously owned british fashion chain jaeger - said : ` i am only just realising how socialist miliband is . i am shocked at this , but labour sound as if they want to stamp on aspiration . ' the criticism will be blow to labour , which this week slipped behind the tories in the polls following a series of bruising battles with big businesses . a succession of company bosses have raised concerns about a lurch to the left under a labour government and accused the party of not supporting business and enterprise . labour 's plans to freeze energy prices and break up the banks recently prompted former marks & spencer boss lord rose to brand mr miliband a ` 1970s throwback ' whose policies echo those of the socialist labour government of that era . mr miliband 's late father ralph was a marxist intellectual who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s . business leader : sir john , pictured , voiced concerns that a labour government would ` pick up some of the flaws of the french economy ' the opposition leader has spoken of the formative influence of his father , recalling political discussions around the dinner table at the family home in primrose hill . mr miliband also alarmed the business community after cosying up to francois hollande 's socialist french government after its 2012 victory . last week one of the world 's biggest investment banks , bank of america warned labour would reduce britain to an economic basketcase like france , with stunted growth and soaring unemployment . sir john ritblat , who retired from british land in 2006 and is now chairman of family property company delancey which is involved in redeveloping the olympic village site in east london , said : . ` i do n't want to go the way of france and other high tax regimes , but there is a real danger that we could end up picking up some of the flaws of the french economy -lrb- under labour -rrb- ' . referring to the financial crisis which started under the previous labour government , sir john - a conservative party donor - said : . ` it is very disappointing that the labour leaders have learnt nothing and forgotten everything . this collective amnesia about the damage caused to the economy under the previous labour government is extraordinary ' . mr miliband was ridiculed for failing to mention the near # 100billion budget deficit in his party conference speech last september . the concerns among business leaders were echoed by fashion entrepreneur harold tillman , 69 . he said : ` labour would be very bad for the economy and very bad for employment . we need to be creating a nation of entrepreneurs . it is idiotic to criticise businesses . ' the boss of one of the country 's leading manufacturers also warned of the danger of returning to failed 1970 's socialism under a labour government . john neill , the chief executive of motor parts and logistics giant unipart , which was carved out of the old british leyland empire , said he has bad memories of the 1970s when british leyland was riven by strikes . he said he is worried about the risk of going back to the ` failed models of the past ' . attacking mr miliband 's plans to freeze energy prices as ` harebrained ' , he said : . ` we can not afford to be complacent . think about china . how do we compete , how do we achieve that if we go back to the failed models of the past . i am concerned we might do that yes . labour has come under attack from a long list of prominent businessmen , including sir charles dunston , the co-founder of carphone warehouse and sir ian cheshire , who ran the diy chain b&q .	 sir john ritblat accused miliband of ` learning nothing ' from financial crisis .   said miliband 's ` family tradition is one of left wing , card carrying marxists '   business leader added he is ` only just realising how socialist ' miliband is .

191	replacement ben spencer had the final say at allianz park after his three second-half penalties saw saracens snatch a 22-17 win over newcastle . andy saull and alesana tuilagi crashed over for the falcons in the first half , either side of a david strettle try , but saracens entered the break with a slender lead through the boot of charlie hodgson . however , a hodgson injury meant scrum-half spencer took over kicking duties in the second half and his three penalties , despite a converted try for will welch , secured the victory . the saracens players celebrate victory over newcastle in the aviva premiership match . jacques burger -lrb- centre -rrb- of saracens is tackled by scott lawson of newcastle falcons . nils mordt -lrb- right -rrb- juggles the ball as he takes on juan pablo socino of newcastle falcons . the two sides put on a showcase of enterprising rugby at kingston park in december - juan socino missing a last-gasp conversion which would have handed the falcons a draw - and this clash started in much the same fashion . saull benefited from a powerful driving maul , formed as a result of tom catterick 's decision to find touch , and the flanker drove on to put newcastle ahead within the opening four minutes . catterick failed to convert and when hodgson was presented with a penalty directly in front of the posts , aviva premiership rugby 's all-time top points scorer reduced the deficit to 5-3 . with just over 10 minutes played , the hosts found more answers after quick hands set up strettle to dive over in the corner , with hodgson converting . however , in a tit-for-tat clash newcastle soon levelled the scores through the bulldozing tuilagi . the 34-year-old picked up the ball and charged down the wing , running straight at last man strettle whose attempted tackle barely slowed the samoan down . half an hour in , hodgson 's close-range penalty put saracens back in front by three points , but moments later the fly-half had to come off with an injury to his hamstring . nevertheless sarries were in the ascendancy and newcastle did well to hold them back before the half-time whistle blew . neil de kock had also left the field due to a knock to his head and his replacement , spencer , would go onto have a vital say in the second half . alex tait 's swift break looked to be leading newcastle to a perfect start and , after numerous phases , another maul formed at the line-out was driven over by captain welch . catterick 's first successful conversion of the afternoon gave the visitors a four-point advantage but only a determined defensive effort from the visitors made sure saracens did not reply immediately . the falcons ' defence eventually gave away a penalty after 56 minutes which a confident spencer made no mistake with . chris wyles -lrb- left -rrb- of saracens evades the tackle of socino as his team beat newcastle 22-17 . marcelo bosch -lrb- centre -rrb- of saracens is tackled by two falcons players during the premiership game . ben ramson -lrb- right -rrb- of saracens tries to evade a challenge from adam powell in the encounter . the scrum-half then nosed saracens ahead five minutes later with another well-taken penalty , this time from the sidelines . catterick broke free from the saracens defence with seven minutes left to play but a second 's indecision from the fly-half , in which he failed to release club top-scorer sinoti sinoti , gave saracens a chance to regroup and quell a dangerous attack . spencer 's third penalty of the afternoon was just as good as his previous , sailing through the posts from 35 yards before the hosts managed to see out the remaining five minutes .	 charlie hodgson got injured , so ben spencer took over kicking duties .   he converted three penalties in the second period to lead saracens to a win .   spencer converted a third penalty on 75 minutes to seal a 22-17 score . 
192	his fist-pumping ` ronny roar ' celebration has become a big noise in recent weeks , but the celtic manager admits he would like to hear his defenders turn up the volume as they prepare to face inter milan in the san siro this week . the sight of ronny deila making his way to the club 's support and whipping the fans into a ferment has added colour to the scottish football season but , while the boss may ooze flamboyant charisma , he admits his team is short of like-minded rabble-rousers . out with the warrior-like presence of his captain scott brown and , when he is in the team , the ebullience of on-loan striker john guidetti , deila admits his team lacks natural leaders , the sort of men who use words to spark their colleagues into action . rory deila has called for more discipline from his team following their 3-3 draw with inter milan . the silent treatment may suffice when facing the routine premiership opposition but , step up a level or two to the europea league , and the norwegian reckons he could be doing with a lot more communication among his defenders . his two full-backs , adam matthews and emilio izaguirre , may like to attack with a certain flamboyance but are among the most reticent footballers you could ever meet . at 19 , jason denayer has the makings of a quality centre-half but has yet to find his voice . even virgil van dijk , a man not short on belief in his own abilities , has had to be coaxed out of his shell by the club 's coaching staff . goalkeeper craig gordon , meanwhile , asserts his authority by exuding a zen-like calm . two rare errors from gordon may offer a partial explanation for the first-leg 3-3 scoreline from three nights ago but deila would also like the men in front of him to assert themselves better . he knows his team must score at least once in italy to have any hope of progressing to the last 16 but a clean sheet would do just as much to help . the portents are not good -- celtic have shipped an eye-watering 23 goals in 13 european matches this season and the prospects of finding a way to plug all the gaps between now and thursday appear slim . celtic striker john guidetti scored injury-time goal to secure an improbable draw against inter milan . that wo n't stop deila trying . organisation will be key on the nerazzurri 's home patch and that 's likely to be a central theme in training this week . ' i think we can keep a clean sheet but we have to cut out the easy mistakes and improve the communication in the team , especially at the back , ' said deila . ` everything is possible . it will be a great achievement if we go through and beat them in milan , but the players have to talk more . ' i think they need matches like this , that 's important . our central defenders are both young and very talented and there 's a lot of attention on them when they play these games . they have to deal with that . ` there are 20 clubs coming to watch them . so it 's mentally tough , especially for young players . ` we have to bring it out of them . we have broony who talks with the players around him but it 's very important to get experience into that central spine of the team . it 's also something to look for when we 're bringing in players -- a leadership style . ` craig speaks a lot with his body -- he 's very calm and reads situations very well but he could also be more vocal . virgil has stepped up in that way , he 's much better than he has been , but he 's still young . so to have an experienced central defender could be a good thing . ' having held on to van dijk in the face of interest from english clubs , including southampton and sunderland , it seems likely that celtic will cash in on the dutch international hopeful at the end of the season . guidetti connected with liam henderson 's pass with a left-footed finish to score against the italian giants . deila has repeatedly gone on record with his desire to extend denayer 's loan transfer from manchester city into a second season but the belgian has been less willing to talk up the chances of another year at parkhead . if deila does indeed find himself in the market for a centre-half with an old head and an active tongue , it wo n't be through choice . ` if i had to choose , i would not bring anybody in , ' he insisted . ` i 'd stick with the two i have because they have the future in front of them . ' that deila is talking about communication is instructive . six months ago , the norwegian had the more fundamental issue of fitness on his mind as his players struggled to adopt the high-tempo pressing game he had deployed at his previous club stromsgodset . in the first leg against inter , deila 's team was unrecognisable from the group that laboured against legia warsaw and , to a lesser extent , maribor in the champions league qualifiers . ` we looked fit , ' he agreed . ` we kept at inter for 90 minutes , pushed them backwards and could keep them under pressure for good periods . ` we were not able to do that six months ago . ' i think we saw that against legia warsaw -- the team could n't cope with it and lost the game big time . so we are taking steps all the time , showing that everything is possible . ` we scored three goals against an italian team , a roberto mancini team , so it 's a good performance . the sad part is we gave away two easy goals . ` we have to defend more in italy but also we have to vary our pressure . the key is to stay compact for 90 minutes because you know they have players who can exploit your mistakes quickly . ' although inter have been displaying shaky form domestically , the concession of three goals in glasgow on thursday was an anomaly -- in the previous eight european ties played this season , mancini 's defence had been breached only twice . leigh griffiths -lrb- left -rrb- and gary mackay-steven congratulate stuart armstrong after celtic 's second goal . the thrust of matthews down the right flank was instrumental in unsettling inter , with the full-back showing drive and then composure to square the ball for stuart armstrong and kick-start the comeback from 2-0 down . armstrong and his old dundee united pal gary mackay-steven were both excellent on their home debuts for the club and they have added extra pace to the mix . ' i think we have a lot of speed in the team now and players who can do something , ' said deila . ` the relationships in the side are better , so we create things from the sides . ' the end of the match brought deila on to the pitch but there was to be none of his trademark theatrics , just a few waves of gratitude at the part played by the crowd on a memorable night . while accepting that a 0-0 scoreline might statistically have given his team a better chance in the return leg , you suspect he would n't have changed a thing about the emotionally-charged match that ended on the crescendo caused by guidetti 's stoppage-time equaliser . ` for me , football is about entertainment , we have to entertain the fans and also get results , ' he added . ` the celtic fans are intelligent , they have seen so much football and they know what they like . ` they were happy because we gave everything and also because we tried to create and attack . ` you have to believe in a style but i 'm not doing this for romance , i 'm doing this to get results and i believe we can do it . '	 celtic drew 3-3 in the europa league round of 32 first leg .   rory delia is calling for a more disciplined performance in the return fixture .   he insists there must be more communications among his defenders .

200	mixed emotions : statue of hitler kneeling in warsaw ghetto where tens of thousands of jews died has upset descendents . a modern artist has caused huge controversy after placing a statue of adolf hitler praying on his knees in the former warsaw ghetto . some jewish groups have expressed fury at the ` senseless ' decision to install the provocative artwork in the area where thousands of jews were forced to live during the rule of the nazi regime . in total , around 300,000 jews from the ghetto died or were sent to their death in concentration camps . the statue by italian artist maurizio . cattelan , entitled ` him ' , has attracted a large number of visitors since . its installation last month . the work is visible only from a distance , and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into hitler 's pose . organisers of the exhibition of which . the statue is a part say its point is to make people reflect on the . nature of evil - but some are angered by its placement in such a . sensitive site . one jewish advocacy group , . the simon wiesenthal center , this week called the statue 's placement ' a . senseless provocation which insults the memory of the nazis ' jewish . victims ' . ` as far as the jews were concerned , . hitler 's only `` prayer '' was that they be wiped off the face of the . earth , ' said the group 's israel director , efraim zuroff . however , others have praised the artwork 's emotional impact . and organisers defend putting it on display in the former ghetto . fabio cavallucci , director of the centre . for contemporary art , which oversaw the installation , said : ` there is . no intention from the side of the artist or the center to insult jewish . memory . controversy : this statue of adolf hitler on his knees praying has been installed in the warsaw ghetto . ` it 's an artwork that tries to speak about the situation of hidden evil everywhere . ' the warsaw ghetto was an area of the city which the nazis sealed off after they invaded poland . they forced jews to live in cramped , inhuman conditions there as they awaited deportation to death camps . many died from hunger or disease or were shot by the germans before they could be transported to the camps . hidden : the statue by italian artist maurizio cattelan is visible only through a hole in a door . fury : the statue has drawn condemnation from jewish groups which regard it as a ` senseless provocation ' the hitler installation is just one . object in a retrospective of cattelan 's work titled ` amen ' , a show that . explores life , death , good and evil . the other works are on display at . the centre itself , which is housed in the ujazdowski castle . the . statue is visible from a hole in a wooden gate across town on prozna . street . viewers only see the back of the small figure praying in a . courtyard . because of its small size , it appears to be a harmless . schoolboy . ` every criminal was once a tender , innocent and defenseless child , ' the centre says in a commentary on the work . visitors : some who have seen the statue praised its shocking emotional impact . thought-provoking : exhibition organisers say they want viewers to reflect on the nature of evil . the warsaw ghetto was established in the polish capital in 1940 , while the country was being occupied by nazi germany . all 400,000 jews living in the city , which was then a major centre of jewish culture , were ordered to live in the area , which was surrounded by a 10ft wall . even though the ghetto housed 30 per cent of warsaw 's population , it occupied just one-fortieth of the city 's area , leading to unbearably cramped conditions . the area was plagued with disease and starvation , causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between july and september 1942 , when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the treblinka camp , where nearly all were murdered by the nazis . in january 1943 , german soldiers started another round of deportations , but this time the jewish residents fought back . the warsaw ghetto uprising briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations , but later that year was brutally put down . 56,000 jews were killed or deported in retribution . poland 's chief rabbi , michael schudrich , said he was consulted on the installation 's placement ahead of time and did not oppose it because he accepted the artist 's attempt to raise moral questions by provoking viewers . he said he was reassured by curators who told him there was no intention of rehabilitating hitler , but rather of showing that evil can present itself in the guise of a ` sweet praying child ' . ' i felt there could be educational value to it , ' said mr schudrich , who also wrote an introduction to the exhibition 's catalogue in which he says art can ` force us to face the evil of the world . ' on friday , a stream of people walked by to view the work , and many praised it . ` it had a big emotional impact on me . it 's provocative , but it 's not offensive , ' said zofia jablonska , a 30-year-old lawyer . ` having him pray in the place where he would kill people - this was the best place to put it . ' cattelan caused controversy in warsaw in 2000 when another gallery showed his work ` la nona ora ' - ` the ninth hour ' - which depicts pope john paul ii being crushed by a meteorite . that offended many in poland , which is deeply catholic and was john paul 's homeland .	 statue of dictator on his knees praying created by artist maurizio cattelan .   jewish group attacks artwork as a ` senseless provocation '   but exhibition organisers defend work about ` the situation of hidden evil '

205	leon brittan died at the age of 75 following a lengthy battle with cancer . today friends said the former home secretary 's final days had been ` dogged by allegations ' explosive claims that leon brittan conspired to cover up an establishment child sex ring are ` wholly unjustified ' , a senior peer said yesterday . only days after he died from cancer , the tory former home secretary was also the subject of wild allegations of ` multiple child rape ' . the second , toxic , claim was made in a newspaper yesterday by labour mp tom watson , who even compared the tory grandee to jimmy savile as he accused him of abusing three boys . lord brittan , who died last wednesday aged 75 after a long battle with cancer , remains under investigation by scotland yard . he was questioned under caution last summer after a labour activist came forward and accused him of raping her in 1967 . the grandee has long been accused of failing to act on an abuse dossier passed to him by tory mp geoffrey dickens in 1983 . yesterday liberal democrat peer lord carlile said the claims were ` based on no evidence ' , adding that lord brittan was ` an important political figure ' whose final months were ` very sad ' . lord carlile , a former counter-terrorism watchdog , highlighted how mr dickens repeatedly praised lord brittan over his response to the ` dossier ' . he said : ` geoffrey dickens praised him explicitly both in the house of commons and in correspondence . ` leon brittan has been the subject of a smear campaign in the media which is wholly unjustified and based on no evidence . ` we know now there 's a further very important point . we know now because it 's been revealed publicly that he was interviewed by the police about an alleged offence not long before he died . no action was taken on it , he was never arrested let alone charged . ' but there are mounting allegations that lord brittan was himself embroiled in a sick world of child abuse . mr watson said one alleged victim told him lord brittan raped him and described him as ` as close to evil as a human being could get ' . mr watson suggested that , as with savile , the dj and tv presenter who was a prolific paedophile , the former minister may have been protected by a reluctance to examine the affairs of the powerful . lord brittan - pictured as british trade and industry secretary - with margaret thatcher in 1986 . writing in the sunday mirror , he called on the police to investigate the claims and described those victims and witnesses he has spoken to as ` sincere ' . and he attacked those who have stood by lord brittan and said they do not believe the victims ' stories . mr watson said : ` their comments were a cold dismissal of those who believe it 's a travesty that brittan will never be asked the truth ; to answer questions about his conduct under oath at a public inquiry . ` it is possible to spend a lot of time with a person and yet know nothing of their true nature . ' speaking about the reaction to his death , he added : ` all the glowing tributes reminded me of the media coverage immediately after jimmy savile 's death ... ` savile was protected by a media culture that worshipped at the altar of celebrity . was brittan protected by a misplaced sense of deference to the powerful ?

213	the majestic transformation of a star has been revealed in a stunning time-lapse of a stellar explosion 20,000 light years away . the animation , spanning four years , documents a huge explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis -- a red star located in the constellation monoceros . before it exploded , v838 had grown to become one of the largest stars ever observed by astronomers , producing 600,000 times more light than our own sun . scroll down for video . the animation , which spans images taken over four years , documents a huge explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis -- a red star located in the constellation monoceros . a light echo is light from a stellar explosion echoing off dust surrounding the star . v838 . monocerotis produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate . surrounding dust , like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls . of an undiscovered cavern . the star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts . light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to earth . because . of this indirect path , the light arrives at earth months after light . from the star that travelled directly toward earth . as it burst , v838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by the hubble telescope to date . the time-lapse uses a series of images captured by hubble between 2002 and 2006 , when v838 monocerotis produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before . as it burst , v838 created an expanding light echo that lit up the cosmic dust surrounding it , creating some of the most stunning images seen by hubble to date . a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view . while the animation appears to show v838 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ` light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity . according to nasa , during echoes , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star . structures that resemble whirlpools in the star are noticeable in the time-lapse , and may have been produced by the effects of magnetic fields in the space between the stars . while the animation appears to show v838 expel material into space , what it is actually showing is an outwardly moving ` light echo ' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity . according to nasa , in a light echo , light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star . scientists still do n't know what caused the explosion . they originally predicted that astronomers were watching a supernova or the thermal pulse of a dying star . but these theories have since been dismissed after discovering the v838 was likely a young star . a paper with contributions from the us naval observatory , the university of arizona and the european space agency concluded : ` when combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour , these characteristics indicate that v838 mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst , for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation . ' v838 mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn -lrb- hence the name monoceros -rrb- , while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter . the sequence captured by hubble from 2002-2004 showing the interstellar dust being illuminated by the star 's explosion .	 animation documents an explosion emanating from v838 monocerotis .   it was captured by hubble and spans the period from 2002 and 2006 .   as it burst , v838 created a light echo that lit up the cosmic dust around it .   scientists still have no idea what caused the stellar explosion of v838 .   a stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas typically expel matter out into space , often obscuring them from view .

215	the secret service was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high-powered rifle at the white house in 2011 in a ` fumbled ' response that left the obamas furious , says a new report . officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after oscar ramiro ortega-hernandez shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in washington from his car . at the time , president barack obama , his wife michelle and their older daughter malia were not at home , but their younger daughter sasha and mrs obama 's mother , marian robinson , were inside . it comes as the secret service is facing more questions over its ability to protect the first family after a knife-wielding man jumped the white house fence and made it to the front doors last friday . scroll down for videos . gunman : secret service officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after oscar ramiro ortega-hernandez -lrb- pictured -rrb- fired at least seven bullets at the white house in washington from his car in 2011 . damage : ortega-hernandez , then 21 , parked his black honda south of the white house , before pointing his gun at the home of the obamas and firing off a series of bullets . above , officers inspect a smashed window . broken : one of the bullets smashed a window on the second floor , just inches from the family 's living room . first family : at the time , president barack obama -lrb- left -rrb- , his wife michelle -lrb- far right -rrb- and their older daughter malia -lrb- second right -rrb- were not at the executive mansion , but younger daughter sasha -lrb- third right -rrb- was inside . the agency 's apparently bungled response to the shooting on november 11 , 2011 , was detailed last night in an investigation by the washington post . in the incident , ortega-hernandez , then 21 , parked his black honda south of the mansion , before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window . he then aimed it directly at the obamas ' home and fired off a series of bullets , one of which smashed a window on the second floor , just inches from the family 's living room . another bullet got stuck in a window frame , while others smashed into the roof , causing nearly $ 100,000 worth of damage . within seconds of the shots , a white house usher reportedly expressed concerns about the safety of malia , who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently . the usher told the staff to keep her sister sasha and ms robinson inside , before locking all of the doors after malia returned with her detail at 9.40 pm , the post said . attack : within seconds of the shots , a white house usher expressed concerns about the safety of malia , who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently , according to a new report by the washington post . weapon : secret service officers , in accordance with protocol , rushed to respond , before they were reportedly told ` no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor . above , the gun used by ortega-hernandez . fleeing : ortega-hernandez is pictured allegedly fleeing from washington aboard a freight train in this 2011 photo introduced by u.s. prosecutors as evidence in federal court in washington . meanwhile , secret service officers , in accordance with protocol , rushed to respond , with one stationed under the second-floor terrace withdrawing her handgun . however , they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed , ` no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor . the supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle , the post said . even after the fact that shots were fired had been confirmed , supervisors initially theorized that rival gangs in separate cars had gotten into a gunfight near the mansion 's front lawn , it said . executive mansion : it apparently took the secret service four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the white house -lrb- pictured -rrb- - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper . the shots were reportedly only connected to the white house four days later when a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement lying on the floor inside . less than a week later , mrs obama , who had arrived back in washington from hawaii after spending the veterans day weekend with her husband , reportedly arranged a meeting with then-secret service director dan sullivan . during the encounter , she addressed mr sullivan so sharply that she could be heard through a closed door , the post reported . angry : president obama was ` infuriated ' by the secret service 's response to the shooting . president obama , who was continuing from hawaii to australia , was also said to have been ` infuriated ' by the secret service 's response to the shooting . one day after the broken glass was spotted , ortega-hernandez , from idaho , was arrested . he was later sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the white house . although prosecutors had initially charged ortega-hernandez with attempting to assassinate president obama , they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year . the post alleges that some secret service officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the white house , but that they were ` largely ignored ' . ` some were afraid to dispute their bosses ' conclusions ' that the shooting was not directed at the white house , it said . the agency allegedly conducted only a cursory inspection of the white house for evidence or damage , while key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found . the suspect was able to park his car on a public street , take several shots and then speed off without being detected , the post noted . it added that it was ` sheer luck ' that ortega was identified as the shooter , mainly because the troubled and jobless 21-year-old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside . the recent allegations were unearthed by the post following interviews with agents , investigators and government officials , as well as the review of hundreds of documents . it comes just a week after omar gonzalez , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn , the secret service said . president obama and his family were not in the mansion at the time . previous incident : last week , omar gonzalez , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn -lrb- pictured -rrb- , the secret service said . white house pair : gonzalez , a 42-year-old iraq veteran -lrb- left -rrb- and kevin carr , a 19-year-old college student -lrb- right -rrb- were both arrested after trying to get into the white house within 24 hours of one another . less than 24 hours later , kevin carr , 19 , was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked . the two attempts to gain entry to the white house prompted the secret service to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building . it has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public . in a statement to the associated press , the secret service said it ` implemented both personnel and structural enhancements ' following a review of the 2011 incident . it also employed ` other physical and technical enhancements , including additional surveillance cameras . ' a secret service official , who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution , said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence . instead , they said it was ` an uncertain situation ' that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports . ` i 'm not saying this was our shining moment , but we never stopped looking for this guy , ' the official said .	 oscar ramiro ortega-hernandez fired at least seven bullets at white house .   president barack obama 's daughter and wife 's mother in mansion at time .   secret service officers rushed to respond , with one withdrawing handgun .   but then told , ` no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor .   agency ` took four days to conclude that a gunman had targeted residence '   obama and wife michelle were ` infuriated ' by response in november 2011 .   comes just a week after man wielding knife jumped the white house fence .

' i accept reform is not easy . but there has to be a smarter and more compassionate way of differentiating between those that can not work and those that do not want to work . ' i am in favour of welfare reform but trying to bulldoze through changes in a reckless and insensitive way is not the right way to go about it .

219	nearly seven in 10 americans believe the united states should shut its doors to foreigners traveling from countries that have seen cases of the ebola virus , and six in 10 say there should be a total ban on incoming travel for everyone -- including americans -- who want to enter the u.s. republicans are overwhelmingly against issuing travel visas to people who have been to the ebola hot zone , with 90 per cent favoring the no-room-at-the-inn approach . older americans also preferred a closed-door policy by large numbers . the gop also leads the field in asking for travel restrictions on anyone entering the u.s. from liberia , sierra leone and guinea . more than three-fourths of republicans hold that view , compared with barely half of democrats . republicans also far outstrip democrats on the question of 21-day forced quarantines for those entering the u.s. from affected countries . two-thirds of gopers think isolating potential patients is a must-do . barely one in three democrats agree . the stunning results come from a mailonline/yougov poll that surveyed 1,000 americans , suggesting they 're eager to see the obama white house embrace the position of australia -- which shut its borders last tuesday to all travelers from ebola-stricken nations -- and of canada , which followed suit on friday . scroll down to read the full polling results . close the borders : significant majorities of americans believe no one ebola-land should be allowed to enter the u.s. -- not even americans who have traveled to the worst-hit countries . vote of no confidence : just 34 per cent of americans say they have faith in president barack obama to manage the ebola crisis the right way moving forward . slow and steady wins a giant raspberry : the obama administration should have been quicker on the uptake when ebola first hit the u.s. , according to 55 per cent of americans , while just 29 per cent say the white house was n't too slow to act . americans overall are split on the question of mandatory ebola quarantines , with 48 per cent saying they believe ` people who have been to ebola-infected areas should be quarantined by the government for 21 days . ' another 29 per cent believe only those showing symptoms of the disease should be forced into isolation . older americans are the most likely to demand quarantines.fully 57 per cent of americans 65 or older fall into that camp , compared to just 41 per cent of those age 18 to 29 . and republicans are 75 per cent more likely than democrats to insist that the government isolate travels who have been to west africa . the obama administration gets low marks for its handling of the crisis . just 10 per cent of americans approve of the job ` ebola czar ' ron klain is doing , with 40 per cent saying they have never heard of him . only 2 per cent of republicans say he 's doing a good job , but democrats do n't support him either . less than one in five of them approve of klain 's work on the issue . fewer republicans than democrats -- 24 to 44 per cent -- have no idea who he is , an indication that klain , a longtime democratic political operative , has become a lightning rod on the right . fully 54 per cent of americans age 29 and under say they have no idea who he is . ron klain who ? obama 's ` ebola czar ' is n't exactly a rousing success , with 40 per cent of americans saying they 've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he 's doing a good job . medical schizophrenia : while more than half of americans approve of encouraging doctors and nurses to donate their talents in ebola-stricken nations , a similar majority thinks that same volunteerism puts public health at risk back in the united states . fifty-five percent -- including 61 per cent of republicans but just 13 per cent of democrats -- agree that the administration has been ` slow to react . ' african-americans match democrats ' 13 per cent showing , largely supporting the white house . obama himself only wins plaudits from 34 per cent of the u.s. population , compared with 49 per cent who disapprove of how he 's handling it . not surprisingly , just 10 per cent of republicans approve of how the president has responded to the ebola crisis . perhaps more shocking is that 35 per cent of democrats would n't agree . obama continues to be a racially polarizing figure as he tackles the public-health threat , the mailonline/yougov poll shows , with 51 per cent of blacks , 46 per cent of hispanics , but just 29 per cent of whites backing him . a similar split dominated the question of whether americans ` have faith ' in the president to handle the problem moving forward . fifty-eight percent of blacks say they do , compared to 29 per cent of whites . just 16 percent of blacks have their doubts . the centers for disease control and prevention , which drew jeers for allowing an ebola-infected nurse to fly on commercial aircraft , has the support of 39 per cent of americans , four percentage points lower than the 43 per cent who disapprove of its performance . gop hard-liners : more than two-thirds of republicans told yougov 's pollsters that they believe the federal government should forcibly quarantine people who enter the us after spending time in ebola-affected nations . democratic softies : fully 62 per cent of democrats believe there 's no need for a 21-day quarantine when people enter the country from liberia , sierra leone or guinea . the obama white house has assumed a leading role in the global fight against the deadly disease , which has infected more than 10,000 people in africa . but barely one-third of americans say the public-health mop-up is the responsibility of the united states . nearly half say it 's not . the administration 's efforts have included deploying military men and women by the thousands to help build field hospitals in liberia and build other critical infrastructure . the cdc has also encouraged scientists and medical personnel to volunteer their time and skills in the ebola hot zone . but while more than half of americans think it 's a good idea to nudge doctors and nurses toward western africa , they feel the opposite about uniformed servicemen and women . younger americans , those under age 29 , are the most likely to have their doubts about putting a lab-coated cadre of temperature-takers in harm 's way . just 44 per cent of them approve and one-third are undecided -- making them the largest demographic group to be scratching their heads over the question . most of the u.s. medical volunteers who have served or are serving overseas combating ebola are under age 30 , according to a physician source at doctors without borders , an international medical relief charity . a clear majority , 53 per cent , say the federal government should not be ` sending military personnel to ebola-infected areas of africa to help battle the disease . ' that number includes 67 per cent of republicans but just 40 per cent of democrats , an unusual case where dovish liberals prefer to deploy troops and hawkish conservatives would rather not . just three in 10 overall approve of the pentagon 's deployments . 34 per cent for obama : the president barely has one-third of americans behind him as he battles the ebola scourge , and nearly one-half disapprove of how he 's handling it . reserving judgment on chris christie : the pugnacious new jersey governor who insists his quarantine policy is the right path has left nearly 2 in 5 americans unsure what to think -- but he 's winning over more than he 's offending . cdc gap at five : the centers for disease control and prevention has a five point approval-gap on ebola , with 39 per cent saying the agency is doing well and 44 per cent disagreeing -- and among those with strong feelings , the dissenters outnumber the applauders nearly two-to-one . the thorny question of what happens to americans who have been exposed to the ebola virus is still vexing the obama administration . already more than 100 military personnel , including a commanding major general , have entered 21-day quarantines on an military base in italy -- to the consternation of the italian military stationed there . and nurse kaci hickox 's refusal to remain isolated during the disease 's potential incubation period became national news after she returned from africa via the newark , new jersey airport . she had a 101-degree fever when she was tested hours after her arrival . hickox spent three days in a hospital isolation tent before the cdc cleared her to go home to the far northern reaches of maine . she has defied public health authorities since then by taking bike rides and strolls , shaking hands with reporters -- including one from mailonline -- and doing her own shopping . the mailonline/yougov poll found that more than half of americans believe that by giving a green light to medical volunteers , the federal government ` could increase the risk of ebola being brought to the united states . ' bring them home : a majority of americans think it was a mistake to send military servicemen and women to western africa , where they have been building field hospitals and providing infrastructure help -- but also potentially exposing them to the deadly ebola virus . inside the numbers : democrats who approve of sending soldiers into ebola 's path far outnumber republicans who back that approach . not our problem : just 36 percent of poll respondents said they agree that it 's america 's job to lead the global ebola response , while 48 percent said it 's not . this week hickox and the obama administration both crossed swords with new jersey governor chris christie , a feisty republican who refused to back down from his insistence that health care workers who show disease symptoms must be quarantined before they can enter the interior of the u.s. from the newark airport . obama objected , blaming christie -- although not by name -- for stoking fear by adopting a more stringent disease control regime than the cdc 's , and the white house may have the public-opinion upper hand . only one-third of americans say they approve of christie 's approach . -- . yougov polled 1,000 americans on october 29 and 30 . the poll has a margin of error of ± 4.3 percentage points . about 90 per cent of those polled said they are registered to vote . the sample was matched and weighted to be representative of the general u.s. adult population on the basis of gender , age , race , education , voter registration , ideology , and geography by region . mailonline-yougov ebola polling / october 2014 by mailonline .	 mailonline/yougov poll finds 60 per cent support outright travel ban for anyone planning to enter the us from one of the affected countries .   larger 69 per cent majority says the us ` should not allow foreigners from ebola infected areas to enter the united states '   48 per cent want mandatory quarantines for everyone who has been to liberia , guinea or sierra leone -- including two-thirds of republicans .   only 10 per cent approve of the job ` ebola czar ' ron klain is doing -- a lower rating than congress .   just 34 per cent ` have faith in the president to handle the ebola crisis effectively ' -- compared to 49 per cent who do n't -- and 55 per cent say the obama administration has been ` slow to react ' to the crisis .   9 out of 10 of those surveyed said they are registered to vote .

226	carrying a guitar can increase the chances of you getting a date by a third , according to a study by researchers from the university of south brittany . the study found that women were 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar - double the amount of people who would give their number to the same man when he was empty-handed . but this technique only works if your a man , women are not seen any more or less attractive if they carry a musical instrument . according to a study by french researchers in brittany , men who carry guitars are seen as more attractive than sporty-looking men . carrying an instrument can boost your chances of getting a date by 31 % . researchers mary cowan from the university of stirling , and anthony little filmed 40 psychology students - half men and half women - explaining which two items they 'd take to a desert island and why , choosing from chocolate , hairspray or a plastic bag . even though they had n't been told about humour , 19 of the 40 students tried to be funny in their responses . the next 11 students were played audio recordings of these 19 participants and asked to rate them for funniness , and for the attractiveness . the magazine revealed that ' a key result is that attractive actors were judged to be funnier . ' it added ` men who were considered funnier also tended to be considered more attractive for both short and long term relationships but especially short term . ' the study was led by professor nicolas gueguen , a researcher in behavioural sciences at the university . gueguen hired a 20-year-old man to approach 300 women aged between 18 and 22 in a shopping centre in brittany . the man told each girl that they were ` really pretty ' and asked for her phone number so they could arrange a date . for the first 100 women he was holding a sports bag . for the next 100 women he approached them holding a guitar case . and for the final 100 women , the man asked them for their number without anything in his hands . when the actor was carrying the guitar case , 31 % of the women gave them his number . when he was carrying nothing , 14 % of the women gave them his number . the biggest turn off for the women was when he was carrying the sports bag , which had a success rate of only 9 % . according to research from the university of . south brittany , women are 31 % likely to give a man their phone number . when he 's carrying a guitar . the biggest turn off for women is men . carrying sports bags . english singer and musician david bowie topped the list of the 20 sexiest male musicians of all time , according to la weekly . the 66-year-old has been married twice . his current wife is somalian fashion model iman abdulmajid . according to guitar world , the top ten songs which all budding musicians must learn if they want to impress a woman are : . 1 . more than words - extreme . 2 . crash - dave matthews band . 3 . melissa - allman brothers band . 4 . just like heaven - the cure . 5 . name - goo goo dolls . 6 . wonderful tonight - eric clapton . 7 . you and me - lifehouse . 8 . baby i love your way - peter frampton . 9 . your body is a wonderland - john mayer . 10 . babe , i 'm gon na leave you - led zeppelin . gueguen 's findings mirror those from a study carried out by the university of tel aviv and ben gurion university last year . in the israeli study , 100 single women were sent facebook friend requests with a message that said : ' i like your photo ' . half of the respondents were sent a request by a man seen strumming a guitar in his profile picture . the other half were sent a request from the same person , but this time he was empty handed . only five -lrb- 10 % -rrb- of the 50 women accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the empty-handed man . yet 28 % accepted the request , or replied to the message sent by the man holding a guitar . the french researchers attribute these findings to the fact that playing a musical instrument is a sign that the man is intelligent , can learn , or is willing to learn , new skills and has independent hobbies . they believe there may also be a link between how musicans are portrayed in the media , and that holding a guitar is a sign of wealth and status . the team from the university of south brittany also wanted to test whether the same theory was true when it came to female musicians . gueguen 's team repeated the israeli study , but used females to send the friend requests . he found there was no difference in the response rate of the men she sent requests to whether she was holding a guitar or not . this suggests that its only women who consider playing an instrument to be an attractive trait .	 women are 31 % more likely to give their number to a man carrying a guitar .   sporty-looking men were the least popular during the french study getting numbers in only 9 % of cases . 
227	the culprit who sparked a murder scare after leaving ' a trail of blood ' along a jetty that was visible on google maps was today revealed to be a wet dog called rama . the ` blood ' seen in the image was in fact a trail of water left by the dog after it went for a swim . rama 's hounding down has ended days of guesswork as to whether a crime scene had been captured by aerial photos . the mystery aerial shot : this image showing what appeared to be a grisly crime scene in a park in the city of almere , netherlands , sparked days of speculation as to what it could really be . the satellite shot from google maps had sparked online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place and gone undetected in the dutch city of almere . first posted on reddit , it shows what looks like a trail of blood apparently leading on to a waterside jetty jutting into a lake in beatrixpark , in the heart of the city . at the end of the trail it appears as though two people are standing over a dead body , preparing to throw it into the water . but investigations carried out by fans of the popular social news site revealed that the ` crime scene ' was in fact nothing of the sort . eagle-eyed internet sleuths used a little-known technique to zoom right into the image to reveal that it was in fact a soggy dog which had left what looked like the bloody trail . and now the dog 's owner has come forward to tell of her surprise when she realised the picture , which went viral online , in fact showed her and a friend out playing catch with her dog , rama . ` when i saw the picture i realised , `` it 's my dog '' . he loves the water , ' she told the sun . ` he jumps off the end of the jetty , swims around to the bridge and runs down to the edge again . ` it 's hilarious that everyone thought it was murder . but it 's great he 's now world famous . ' detailed analysis : once one reddit user revealed how fellow laptop sleuths could zoom in more closely to the image posted by ncav , they began annotating the image to attempt to prove the wet dog theory . even more detailed analysis : another reddit user posted this image which attempted to explain what was going on in the ambiguous-looking scene in even greater detail . the city of almere where the bizarre google maps image was captured is holland 's newest city and . home to more than 193,000 people . the first homes were only completed in 1976 . the . image was originally posted on april 12 by a reddit user named ncav , . with the caption : ' a murder near my house on google maps , link in . comments .

230	a tanker loaded with $ 100 million of crude oil that has been at the center of a dispute over iraq 's oil billions vanished off the coast of texas on thursday . the kurdish tanker disappeared from coast guard radar screens following a month of legal wrangling over whether it can offload its cargo in the u.s. . as the disintegration of iraq amid mounting violence continues , the semi-autonomous regime in kurdistan -- in the north of iraq -- is trying to cash in on iraq 's oil reserves and export its own crude . oil tanker united kalavyrta -lrb- also known as the united kalavrvta -rrb- , which is carrying a cargo of kurdish crude oil , approaching galveston , texas on july 25 . the boat has since disappeared from coast guard radar . a still image from video taken by a u.s. coast guard hc-144 ocean sentry aircraft shows the oil tanker united kalavyrta sitting in the gulf of mexico . iraqi kurdistan has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since may , energy experts told al arabiya news . but the increasingly weak regime in baghdad is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the kurdish regime can not sell the oil in the u.s. . the u.s. coast guard 's ais ship-tracking system showed no position for the united kalavrvta on thursday , which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark . the tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea , off the coast of texas , after leaving the turkish port of ceyhan in june and anchoring near the u.s. port of galveston in late july . the u.s. coastguard confirmed to mailonline today that the last contact the agency had with the united kalavyrta was when the ship 's certificate of compliance was completed on july 27 . the vessel 's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between baghdad and the kurds over the right to export oil . several other tankers transporting disputed oil from iran or kurdistan have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track . a coast guard official told mailonline today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the gulf of mexico , which it is not supposed to do . the official also said it was possible the ship had traveled outside the range of the u.s. coastguard antennas which would account for it vanishing from the ais ship-tracking system . legal dispute : the vessel 's disappearance is thought to be the latest development in a high stakes argument between baghdad and the kurds over the right to export oil . earlier this year , cutbacks in spending at the u.s. coastguard have meant that longer-range antennas in the gulf of mexico have been gradually shutting down , the official said , making it harder to track ships that move further away from the shore . u.s. coastguard also told mailonline on friday that it had no plans to search areas of the gulf where the ship had been anchored . the tanker kamari , which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from iraqi kurdistan turned off its satellite transponder on august 17 , north of egypt 's sinai . it reappeared unladen on august 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of israel , ship tracking data on reuters showed last week . it was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was . a spokesman for the kurdistan regional government -lrb- krg -rrb- ministry of natural resources would not comment on the tanker 's temporary disappearance at the time . reuters reported on july 31 that tanker united emblem , which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of kurdish oil , had been offloaded into another tanker in the south china sea . a senior executive at marine management services confirmed in july that the ship-to-ship transfer involving the united emblem took place in a ` legitimate operation ' . the ship is ` fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations , ' said kostas georgopoulos , the chartering manager at marine management services . ` the ship is still in international waters , ' he added . the agency has a hc-144 ocean sentry aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the oil tanker united kalavyrta on july 25 . only a few days ago , the partially-full kamari tanker carrying kurdish crude oil , disappeared from satellite tracking north of egypt 's sinai peninsula . two days later , the empty vessel reappeared near israel . in late july , the tanker united emblem offloaded part of its cargo of kurdish crude oil onto another ship in the south china sea . the evasive behavior is the result of baghdad wanting to block the kurds from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so . the iraqi government in baghdad has filed a lawsuit in a u.s. court to reclaim control of the united kalavrvta cargo and block the kurdistan regional government -lrb- krg -rrb- from delivering its cargo . the suit demonstrates that baghdad is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block kurdistan 's oil deals , which they view as smuggling . however , the kurds see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence . on monday , the u.s. court threw out the order saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast . but the judge invited iraq to re-plead its case over the cargo 's rightful ownership . the issue is expected to fuel tensions between washington and baghdad , as in theory , iraq can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil . a coast guard official said the vessel in the gulf of mexico might have turned off its beacon , sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders , or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service . however , dozens of vessels were visible on thursday in the galveston offshore lightering area , where the kurdish tanker was last seen . the united kalavrvta 's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between baghdad and the kurds over the right to export oil .	 united kalavrvta , carrying one million barrels , has disappeared in the gulf of mexico on thursday .   ship was anchored near texas in preparation to unload its cargo to u.s. when it went dark .   legal dispute with iraq and the semi-autonomous region of kurdistan means ship was in limbo for a month .   iraq sees kurdish oil deals as smuggling and wants to block future exports .   they filed lawsuit in u.s. court to order retrieval of cargo but case rejected .   u.s. coast guard now believes ship has turned off its identifying beacon . 
231	secret policy : banking giant hsbc has admitted a series of withdrawals were stopped or reduced when customers failed to provide evidence of what it was for . bank customers who try to withdraw large sums of cash over the counter face a grilling and may be asked to provide written confirmation of why they need the funds . under pressure to crack down on fraud , branch staff are increasingly demanding customers supply evidence of what they plan to spend their own money on . hsbc last year introduced new rules which allow staff to block a demand for cash unless you can prove what it 's for . this could include booking receipts , an invoice , a quote for work or even a letter . lenders including santander , barclays and the nationwide building society also now reserve the right for counter staff to request such proof if they fear the withdrawal could be linked to fraud . banks lose # 475million to fraud each year , according to figures from the financial fraud action uk trade body . in particular , a rise in scams such as ` vishing ' has put many banks on high alert . vishing -- where crooks hijack a customer 's phone line and convince them to hand over their account details -- can include persuading victims to withdraw large sums of cash over the counter . banks say they need to strike a balance between allowing customers easy access to their money whenever they want it , and fighting fraudsters . if staff notice a rise in such frauds in their local area , they are more likely to introduce tough restrictions . however , innocent customers have had genuine demands for cash repeatedly rejected . earlier this month an hsbc customer who wanted to repay a family loan was told he could n't take # 7,000 from his instant access savings account . policy : the bank has admitted it changed its policy in november and told on account holder they did not have to notify him . counter . staff informed stephen cotton , from worcestershire -- a loyal customer . for nearly 30 years who was well-known at the branch -- he had to produce . a letter as proof . he told . the bbc 's money box : ` when we presented them with the withdrawal slip , . they declined to give us the money because we could not provide them . with a satisfactory explanation for what the money was for . they wanted a . letter from the person involved .

232	two in five young women in london have experienced sexual harassment in public spaces in the last year . forty-one per cent of women aged 18 to 34 said they had encountered unwanted contact or attention in the capital , such as wolf-whistling , sexual comments , staring or exposure , according to a yougov poll . campaigners have called for more research into the problem , which they say leaves women across the country feeling threatened and uncomfortable . intimidating : two in five young women said they had experienced attention such as wolf-whistling and sexual comments . the research compiled by the end violence against women coalition found that 21 per cent of women of all ages had experienced unwanted sexual attention and 4 per cent of all women had been subjected to unwanted sexual touching . the survey also asked female londoners about their experiences while on public transport , and found 31 per cent of women aged 18 to 24 received unwanted sexual attention . fourteen per cent of women of all ages said they encountered unwanted sexual attention , while one in 20 experienced unwanted sexual touching . some claimed they had been harassed while onlookers did nothing to help them . one victim , music photographer rosie wadey , 20 , said she had been sexually assaulted three times since moving to london . she said each incident had begun with her being harassed in the street . describing the most recent assault , which happened in liverpool street station , she said that a man had approached her at about 11.30 pm as she used a cash point . ` he followed me and would not stop talking to me , ' she told the independent . ` by that point , i had made it perfectly clear that i did not want to talk to him . ` he put his arm around me . he asked me things like , `` do you have a boyfriend ? '' , `` want to come back to my house ? '' . i got more and more aggressive , and this person is not taking the message . ` it got to the point where he put his hand on my head and pulled me by my hair , and i screamed at him . ' sarah green , 36 , said being harassed was a ` common experience ' for her , particularly while cycling in the capital . ` it can be quite seasonal , ' she said . ` it 's worse when the weather is better . ` it 's a minority of people who behave in this way , but they probably do it again and again . victims : rosie wadey , left , and vicky simister , right , have both been subjected to sexual harassment in public . ` you 'll have someone in the passenger seat , waiting at the lights , just calling out offensive stuff . ' ms green described an occasion when she was followed by two men in a white van while cycling in bermondsey . ` they said something to me that was quite rude and that day i had had enough , ' she said . women told the yougov survey that they felt threatened by men approaching them and giving them unwanted sexual attention . here are some of the comments from respondents : . ' i feel safer on public transport than i do walking around , but i have still experienced several nasty incidents of sexual harassment on the tube where i have been forced to change carriage or leave the train a stop early to avoid harassment from men . ' ` feel unsafe at night if i am alone and travelling home . i often move carriages on the tube to feel safer or change buses . ' ` have had some issues when travelling on the top deck of a bus , especially at night , so do n't feel safe up there . safer to sit nearer the driver . ' ` some people will say it 's trivial or even a bit flattering , but women will tell you it 's not because , if you tell them to stop it , the situation can escalate quite quickly . ` we were on a main road and , after i turned on to a minor road , they followed me for three streets at speed . ' i had to pick up my speed and race away . they were shouting all sorts of offensive things at me - four-letter words - and it was really threatening . ' ms green said motorists would shout negative comments about her appearance , as well as positive , and that experience could also be intimidating . ` sometimes it 's men telling you that you 're fat or that you 're ugly and that you need to sort yourself out , ' she said . ` now i pity these men , but when i was younger i felt threatened and it determined how i felt about myself . ' the coalition commissioned the survey to highlight the everyday impact of sexual harassment and how it makes women feel unsafe . it said 45,000 incidents of domestic violence and 3,000 rapes were reported to police in london last year . another victim of sexual harassment , vicky simister , 27 , decided to found a campaign group , the uk anti street harassment campaign , after she was attacked by a group of men at manor house underground station in north london in 2010 . she said : ' i was walking along the street when a group of men in a car pulled up alongside me . ` it was dark and they started trying to talk to me and making comments about my appearance . ` they slowed down and followed me as i walked to the tube station , which took about 15 minutes . ' i was really wound up and frustrated and i told them to leave me alone . pursued : cyclist sarah green was followed by two men who made lewd comments to her . ` they followed me into the station and pinned me against the wall . i had to be helped by members of the public . ' ms simister said of the survey results : ` in order to address this , local councils and the police need to convey a strong message that this behaviour will not be tolerated by perpetrators . ` it is important to note that this is not a london-only problem , and a national survey needs to happen to understand the extent of the problem . ` we hope that london can lead the way in addressing this issue - particularly in light of the impending olympics and international perceptions of our nations attitude to women 's safety . ' ms simister decided to set up her campaign group after she was attacked by a group of men at manor house underground station in north london . coalition co-chairman professor liz kelly said : ` our survey shows that sexual harassment in london is extremely common . ` some survey respondents also said that this behaviour makes them feel uncomfortable and unsafe and makes them change their behaviour and decisions about when and where to travel . ` despite this high prevalence and impact however , public sexual harassment is a form of abuse which generally goes unchallenged , creating an unsafe and unequal environment for women . ` we need investment in public campaigns on transport and elsewhere saying this behaviour is unacceptable , and training for transport staff and police about how to respond to it . ' women who responded to the survey described having to change carriage or leave a stop early after experiencing harassment on the train or tube , while others said they avoided sitting on the top decks of buses . raising awareness : professor liz kelly called for more investment in campaigns on public transport . the coalition said research was lacking into the scale of the problem in the uk , but some international studies appear to show that as many as four in five women have experienced sexual harassment . it has sent its findings to transport for london and urged the body to begin a campaign making the public aware that sexual harassment can be a crime and is unacceptable . it is also calling for more training for police and transport staff to deal with reports of sexual harassment . bryony beynon , co-director of hollaback london , a campaign aimed at ending street harassment , said : ` these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg . ` from unwanted sleazy comments to violent sexual assault , street harassment is an epidemic in london . ` our website gets thousands of hits a month from women looking for support , reassurance and a chance to speak out about their often horrifying daily experiences . ` whether 13 or 70 years old , time and time again they ask `` what did i do to deserve this ? '' ` wider social change through community education as well as more robust enforcement of the laws designed to protect women in public is desperately needed . ` until then , men who harass need to wake up to the damage this behaviour is having on a daily basis . '	 21 per cent of women of all ages have experienced unwanted sexual attention , survey finds .   one in 25 has been subjected to unwanted sexual touching .   campaigners call for greater awareness of how harassment threatens women .   photographer reveals how she has been assaulted three times since moving to london .

236	anderson silva broke down in tears after making a successful return to the octagon with a dominant win over nick diaz at ufc 183 . it was far from a vintage performance from the 39-year-old but he did at least begin to lay to rest the ghosts of his horror leg break against chris weidman more than a year ago . silva was awarded every round by two of the judges as he consistently beat diaz to the punch on the californian 's middleweight debut . video scroll down to watch anderson silva 's emotional reaction after win . anderson silva -lrb- right -rrb- beat nick diaz on his return to the octagon after more than a year on the sidelines . silva attempts a right knee as he dominated diaz for the majority of the five-round main event . silva fell to the canvas in tears after he was announced the winner on his return from a year out injured . diaz helped his opponent back to his feet after silva collapsed on hearing himself declared the victor . silva and diaz embrace after sharing five rounds in the octagon as they both returned from lay-offs . anderson silva bt nick diaz via ud . tyron woodley bt kelvin gastelum via sd . al iaquinta bt joe lauzon via tko . thales leites bt tim boetsch via sub . thiago alves bt jordan mein via tko . miesha tate bt sara mcmann via md . derek brunson bt ed herman via tko . john lineker bt ian mccall via ud . rafael natal bt tom watson via ud . ildemar alcantara bt richardson moreira sd . thiago santos bt andy enz via tko . ` this was important for me and important for my whole family , ' silva said . ' i went through a lot of suffering -lsb- after the broken leg -rsb- and in the beginning , i did n't think i 'd be back . ' silva is renowned for his antics in the octagon but was uncharacteristically subdued in the opening round as diaz opted to start the mind games by briefly lying on the canvas and constantly chattering away to his opponent . he threw an early kick but both men were content to circle the other in the opening stages . silva landed a one-two as diaz swung and missed with his right leg . after 90 seconds with barely a shot thrown , silva launched forward with his hands but missed , allowing diaz to respond with a leg kick before he too switched up top . the former champion finished the round strongly however , landing with two jabs before launching a knee at a backed-up diaz . the second session also started slowly but silva showed no sign of nerves as he flicked out his previously injured leg . diaz also focused on landing his kicks but took a swift right-left combination to the face . an attempted takedown was thwarted by the brazilian and he again caught the judges ' eyes in the closing seconds . although not at his best , silva was landing on diaz and the californian 's face began to mark up around his left eye in the third stanza which would late require stages . he continued to goad silva but the octagon legend refused to be drawn in , instead focusing on landing leg kicks on diaz . diaz lay down in the first round , taunting silva but the former champion refused to engage in the mind games . diaz continued to taunt silva , beckoning him to come forward but the brazilian remained disciplined . silva had consistent success with his kicking and did not seem troubled by the leg he injured in 2013 . when diaz had success , it was with his kicking as he attempted to break down silva on his return . diaz later claimed he thought he had won every round but punches like this were a rare sight in the fight . silva embarked on a victory lap of the octagon after the final bell of his middleweight clash with diaz . diaz was badly marked up around his left eye after he was outlanded by silva over the five rounds . the american did at least start the penultimate round brightly but his successes were few and far between . silva looked light on his feet as he circled away before landing a right hand . but again there was little to keep the mgm grand crowd enthused and there were a smattering of discontented voices among the cheers for silva . when diaz did come forward , silva responded , landing a double jab and leg kick to fend off his attacker . needing a finish in the final five minutes , diaz engaged briefly but was unable to land cleanly as silva eased through to the bell . after a parade lap around the octagon , he leapt out to embrace light-heavyweight champion jon jones before the verdict was announced . after crumbling to the canvas in a mixture of joy and relief , he was helped back to his feet by diaz . ` i 'll go back to my family , to my home , talk to my kids , and i do n't know -lsb- about fighting again -rsb- , ' silva added . ` when i called my family and my son says , `` congratulations but no more fights '' . ' i love my job but i need to talk to my family because it 's more important . ' diaz , meanwhile , claimed : ' i felt i was ahead most of the time . i felt i won every round . i was the one coming forward . ' silva and diaz grapple at close quarters but spent most of the fight keeping their distance from one another . silva lands right kick to diaz 's ribs as he continued his assault on the american 's body . silva embraces his team following his successful return to the octagon after his year on the sidelines . silva walks to the octagon for the first time in over a year at the mgm grand in las vegas .	 anderson silva dominated nick diaz over five rounds at ufc 183 .   silva was making his return after a year on the sidelines through injury .   the brazilian superstar won by scores of 50-45 -lrb- twice -rrb- and 49-46 .   silva lay on the canvas and cried after the result was announced .

245	shadow minister for sport clive efford was first to berate the premier league for not spending enough on grassroots football after the jackpot # 5billion tv rights deal was announced . efford said : ` these are incredible sums of money and it would be nothing short of criminal if none of the extra money goes to expand participation at the grassroots of football . ' yet it did not escape premier league notice that on wednesday -- the day after the tv bonanza was secured -- efford was at the opening of a new # 400,000 3g football facility in his eltham constituency funded by the premier league and fa . clive efford criticised the premier league for not spending more of its tv rights riches on grassroots football . sky sports , whose pundits include graeme souness -lrb- left -rrb- and thierry henry , secured five of seven premier league packages in the new deal from 2016-17 at a cost of more than # 11m per match . it also emerged that the premier league had wanted their name added to efford 's quotes in the press release acknowledging the work of the football foundation in delivering the project . but efford declined the request , saying his words were fine as they stood . the mp said the premier league should ` live up to their promise ' that five per cent of their domestic tv income goes towards growing the game . the premier league 's answer is that , along with their solidarity payments , they already contribute more . but efford insists : ` if that was the case there would be a lot more pitches and coaches at community level . ' the england cricket board will allow struggling one-day captain eoin morgan to play in the entire indian premier league , for which the auction takes place next monday . morgan , who has failed to score runs in the world cup build-up , is fortunate to have the go-ahead from both county middlesex and england , with whom he has an incremental contract , to play all the ipl when the issue has caused big problems in the past -- particularly for kevin pietersen . the domestic twenty20 starts in may , before the end of the ipl , but the ecb have relaxed their approach because it will be good experience for players ahead of the 2016 world twenty20 in india . england 's innovative eoin morgan will be allowed to play the entire indian premier league . the odi skipper will be available to ipl franchises at the tournament 's auction taking place next monday . hollywood star willem dafoe got a big hug rather than the cold shoulder from jose mourinho . chelsea manager jose mourinho may be avoiding talking to the media or aborting interviews if he does not like the question . however , hollywood film star willem dafoe was in the chelsea press room on wednesday night and received a rather more friendly greeting . there was a big hug , followed by the pair leaving arm in arm with dafoe invited into the dressing room . mourinho , a bt sport ambassador , is understood to have met dafoe while filming for the tv network . mourinho , a bt sport ambassador , is understood to have met dafoe while filming with the broadcaster . chelsea , who need to find a new shirt sponsor now a mooted deal with turkish airlines has stalled , have brought in former liverpool chief executive christian purslow to head their revamped commercial operation . purslow in turn has hired outside agency hth associates to help him in the hunt . hth was formed by two ex-manchester united commercial executives , leo thompson and harry horsley . however , using old trafford sponsorship expertise does not automatically work -- as the fa have found with former united global sponsorship manager phil barker failing to find a backer for the fa cup this season . the poor state of bradford 's valley parade pitch ahead of their fifth-round fa cup tie against sunderland on sunday has not been helped by impoverished groundsman mick doyle having to improvise with a homemade snowplough put together from old pieces of wood . belatedly , bradford have agreed to new equipment and having the pitch relaid with the proceeds from their cup run . the dire state of bradford 's valley parade pitch during their win over mk dons at home on monday . mk dons ' keith andrews struggles with a bobble on the bradford pitch , which will be relaid . the england cricket board , despite sacking around 15 staff , have invested in outside agency futureproof to come up with ways of inspiring the team . the first collaboration is #loveengland , which is only a marginal improvement on the bizarre #rise campaign for the ashes . a promotion for the england cricket board 's collaboration with futureproof to promote the national team . alexander 's a red devil . the sighting of manchester united club secretary john alexander mouthing the words of liverpool anthem you 'll never walk alone in the anfield directors ' box for the midweek game against tottenham is unlikely to go down well with united fans . alexander , who arrived at old trafford from spurs , has a strong allegiance to liverpool . so much so , former united manager sir alex ferguson used to give him plenty of stick .	 shadow minister for sport clive efford criticised the premier league for not channeling enough tv rights money into grassroots football .   but efford did n't mention the league and fa 's funding of a new 3g pitch .   eoin morgan is fortunate to be cleared to play the entire ipl tournament .   jose mourinho gave actor willem dafoe a warm stamford bridge welcome .   bradford will belatedly relay their dire pitch for funds from fa cup run . 
246	click here to read why stuart lancaster is running out of time to find his best team . i hugely admire rugby league as a sport and the players who take the field . at its best the balance between athletic prowess , skill-set and sheer bloody toughness makes league one of the great sports . i can not wait to see sam burgess play for bath , i 'm sure he has everything to succeed in union and all england rugby fans should be grateful to bath for bringing him into the sport . that said , we need to be realistic -- for burgess 's sake as much as anything . to suggest burgess is the answer to england 's poor showing in the backline so far this autumn would be dangerous -- he has n't played a game of union yet ! sam needs to get on with his game , a challenge he 'll throw himself into . sam burgess is expected to make his debut for bath on saturday . burgess speaks with bath and possible future england team-mate george ford -lrb- left -rrb- during training . burgess poses with a young baby after attracting crowds to a bath training session . but equally the england setup and their fans ca n't sit back and think ` it 's ok , we 'll have sam burgess in a couple of months . ' the focus should remain on our current options until he is ready . making the transition to union and performing at test match level is going to take time . if you put him on the field at twickenham on saturday he 'd get horribly exposed . i 'd love to see him in the world cup squad but the time-frame is very tight . the biggest challenge for burgess will be understanding the technicalities and subtleties of playing at inside centre in both attack and defence . as has become apparent this autumn , the no 12 holds the keys to the backline . he is not a jason robinson or israel folau , who can devastate teams with raw speed and athleticism . those types of players have tended to be more successful at crossing over codes . burgess 's game is based more on explosive power and smashing through tackles . at the highest level of rugby union that simply wo n't be enough . he needs to learn a kicking game , gain an understanding of the patterns run in union and work on his distribution . the biggest challenge for him will be at the breakdown . unlike in league , it is after the hit that so much happens . i suspect he wo n't enjoy hitting rucks but in many ways you do n't want him smashing into rucks because that would n't be the best use of his many qualities . burgess faces a tough challenge after crossing over from rugby league to union . the 25-year-old is congratulated by sydney rabbitohs ' owner russell crowe after winning the grand final . burgess has starred for england at the 2013 rugby league world cup . we know how hard he can tackle but how quickly can he get over the ball and how effectively he can hold up his man in a choke tackle ? he has the ability to be world class in this area and the speed at which he learns these skills will be crucial in determining how quickly he progresses into a white england shirt . it is asking a lot for him to be ready in time for the world cup . the more i think about it , i think he will end up playing in the back row . if that happens he will not be such a significant addition to england 's squad . there is already great depth in the back row . it is in the midfield that they need new ideas . it 's a quandary . one thing burgess will undoubtedly bring is sheer outright toughness . i was offered a contract to sign for warrington in 1980 but turned it down because i did n't think i was tough enough to cut in it in rugby league . a couple of years later i played union for manly in sydney , where the two codes are pretty close . i watched a lot of league and it left me with a massive respect for the sport . the preparation and detail those players put into every training session and every match was light-years ahead of union at that time . burgess speaks to bath head coach mike ford -lrb- left -rrb- ahead of his expected aviva premiership debut . england coach stuart lancaster -lrb- centre -rrb- is still deliberating over his best central line-up . billy twelvetrees will replace owen farrell at no 12 for england 's final autumn test against australia . even today the speed and quality of pass and the ability to simply but so effectively time their running lines from deep always stands out to me . they are still ahead of union . i would still get burgess into the england camp at the earliest opportunity even if his first start comes later . he will raise the standards and will prompt a far greater response than 10 visits from michael johnson and gary neville . i 'm not saying burgess can not make it as a union player . i am sure he will . but i would urge caution about the time-frame . kyle eastmond said recently it took him the best part of a year to really feel like a union player . burgess does not have that time on his side . when i became england head coach i 'd followed league all my life and knew exactly the type of player jason robinson was when i brought him across . like folau , robinson was a sensational athlete whose quick feet set him apart . but i never considered playing him in a key decision-making position such as 12 , one of the most challenging positions . jason robinson made a successful crossover from league to union under sir clive woodward . all eyes will be on burgess if he makes his rugby union debut against harlequins on saturday . it 's exciting for rugby as a whole that burgess could be starting for bath against harlequins . he 's in the perfect place at bath , where mike ford -- a former rugby league player himself -- is head coach . i really do envy the opportunity to coach him . the way you look after someone like burgess is by not trying to change them . educate them , but allow them to interpret the game themselves . if you do that , you might end up with a unique union player . i 'm excited about burgess and england rugby fans should be , too . but the clock is ticking ahead of the world cup .	 sam burgess has crossed codes from rugby league to rugby union .   the former bradford bulls star is set to make his bath debut on saturday .   it is too early to herald burgess as england 's saviour at the world cup . 
247	chelsea were denied a certain penalty when matt targett tripped cesc fabregas as the chelsea man knocked the ball past the southampton defender . it was as clear a penalty as you could want to see but referee anthony taylor not only denied the league leaders , but he also cautioned the spaniard for diving . chelsea have been criticised a lot of late for their players simulating offences ; most recently branislav ivanovic on boxing day against west ham . cesc fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by southampton youngster matt targett . fabregas looks dejected as he lays on the turf after being denied a penalty at st mary 's . fabregas -lrb- centre -rrb- was booked by referee anthony taylor for an apparent dive during the second half . the chelsea midfielder reacts as referee taylor shows him a yellow card during the match at st mary 's . prior to that willian and diego costa were both cautioned for simulation against hull and gary cahill should have been and i can only conclude that taylor was affected by this ` previous ' . select group referees meet up regularly and discuss issues and trends to prepare as best they can for their next assignments . preparation is perfectly acceptable but prejudgment is not . chelsea remain top and by definition are still the best team in the league so far ; they deserve better from the officials but also need to acknowledge that they have contributed to this problem themselves . chelsea 's branislav ivanovic -lrb- centre right -rrb- was involved in a simulation storm vs west ham on boxing day . ivanovic -lrb- centre right -rrb- appeared to throw himself to ground after minimal contact from andy carroll -lrb- centre -rrb- . ivanovic was attempting to win a penalty for chelsea that could have put his side 2-0 up in the first half . the defender surged into the west ham penalty area but went to ground too easily . hammers players , including the accused offender carroll -lrb- centre left -rrb- , swarm around ivanovic after his fall .	 chelsea drew 1-1 at southampton in sunday 's premier league clash .   visitors thought they should have had a second half penalty .   cesc fabregas was tripped inside the penalty box by matt targett .   referee anthony taylor booked fabregas for simulation . 
248	hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box . whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the manchester united vs chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating . and that means fewer goals in the barclays premier league . for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring . it 's time to end that . so join us in our campaign to say hands off in the box to players and referees . we 'll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it . a few years ago , during a promotional event with some journalists at qpr 's harlington training ground , one of the world 's finest central defenders made his way into the penalty area to wait for a corner . as the ball was launched in , he pulled down hard on his marker 's shirt on the blindside of the referee to prevent his opponent jumping and used it to propel himself into the air . he scored with a header easily enough and made the sap on the end of it look like he did n't fancy aerial combat with a top class centre half -lrb- true , as it happened -rrb- . john terry ran away chuckling , laughing at the naivety more than anything -lrb- plus the fact he had swapped sides at half-time with his team leading 5-0 and had brought it back to five-all -rrb- . for the avoidance of doubt this is not an attack on terry 's integrity because he is one of the finest defenders this country has produced . at 33 he is playing better than ever in chelsea colours . he did , however , provide a fascinating insight into the tricks of the trade used by players competing at the very highest level . stuff goes on and the players just hope to hell that the referee does n't spot it or , if he does , lets you get away with it . which brings us nicely to the official phil dowd , the poor fella who is still being given a good kicking three days on from manchester united 's 1-1 draw with chelsea . on sunday afternoon , in the seconds before robin van persie 's dramatic equaliser for united , a text message arrived from the boss : ` are you mad ?! ' . phil dowd had his work cut out at old trafford on sunday trying to spot all the grappling and wrestling . sat in the mail 's kensington office he was reacting to a tweet , sent from the press box at old trafford , that had the audacity to praise dowd 's performance involving two highly-charged teams who did not want to give an inch . here is the offending tweet : ` this is n't terribly fashionable to say , but phil dowd has refereed this game brilliantly ' . in the marks awarded on mailonline , dowd was given an eight out of 10 . that 's a decent mark in the biggest game of the season and more than any of the players or the managers received . what a crime that turned out to be on an afternoon when people were not quite sure who was man of the match and who had the upper hand . still , when in doubt , give the referee the mother of all kickings . sitting at home , or in the office , it is easy to re-referee a football match when there are 26 -lrb- sometimes more -rrb- cameras inside a stadium . john terry holds on to marcos rojo while defending a corner against manchester united . terry grabs rojo while the argentine holds nemanja matic 's shirt and the serb gives some back . those replays , plus the commentary , along with full-time and half-time analysis , do n't half come in handy . terry and branislav ivanovic were ` double headlocked ' at ever corner according to chelsea 's captain . the pictures of the pair grappling with chris smalling and marcos rojo backed him up . dowd was given an eight for , by and large , keeping these warring teams on the straight and narrow by issuing eight yellow cards and dismissing ivanovic . the default mechanism in the game is thus : there is a man in authority , so give him the coating because the pgmol , the match officials ' guardian angels , prevent the poor sucker defending himself in a post-match press conference . match officials are soft , soft targets . terry is bundled to the floor by rojo -lrb- right -rrb- as chris smalling wrestles with branislav ivanovic -lrb- centre -rrb- . as reporters , we will never have to justify ourselves to dowd , or any other match official , because we rarely come across them -lrb- apart from a nod and a handshake at st george 's park on international weeks -rrb- . the players and managers are different because we are more likely to come across them in press conferences or in mixed zones down by the tunnel area . gary neville believed juan mata was manchester united 's best player in the first half . by the time he was substituted in the 66th minute he had touched the ball just 35 times . marouane fellaini , the man who smothered cesc fabregas and is now apparently fully acclimatised to life at united , had the third worst passing record in the home team . fabregas , subdued it has to be said , was upgraded to a seven because he provided the killer ball for drogba to put chelsea in front . goals pay the rent and all that . dowd -lrb- right -rrb- lays down the law to a smiling cesc fabregas during the clash at old trafford . dowd dismisses branislav ivanovic -lrb- left -rrb- for a second bookable offence after a foul on angel di maria -lrb- right -rrb- . back to dowd . to put his performance at old trafford into perspective , the pgmol asked a 51-year-old man to make key decisions when he is trying to keep up with twenty-something footballers who often hoover 100 metres in less than 11 seconds . in addition we are asking a guy who is usually on the move to make the correct decision in a top class sporting arena with 22 players launching themselves into a full-bloodied contact in all areas of the pitch . sat in the office , the boss will benefit from the 26 or more cameras stationed at old trafford to help the broadcaster , in this case sky , come to a conclusion . was dowd right ? ` well let 's take a look at the replay ...

250	i wonder if rio ferdinand was true to his word at 10.30 on saturday night ? in the trailer announcing the arrival of the fiftieth anniversary season of match of the day , qpr 's new centre half says that as soon as he hears the show 's iconic theme tune , he drops everything and heads for the telly . or perhaps this weekend , after his debut for his new team that siren song actually sounded more like the theme from jaws ? and saw peckham 's finest getting out of earshot , and sharpish ! because prior to the inaugural weekend of the new premier league season , we had been promised by the bbc that their old dog would show us a few new tricks . and that the pundits would be encouraged to let fly with their opinions . video scroll down for hansen 's infamous remark : ` you ca n't win anything with kids ' copped it : rio ferdinand -lrb- pictured -rrb- was heavily criticised by alan shearer on match of the day . at fault : shearer blamed ferdinand -lrb- second right -rrb- for failing to mark james chester -lrb- far right -rrb- for his goal . so was saturday night the dawn of a new shearer ? well , for instance , they certainly took no prisoners when the boys discussed their old pal from the world cup studio in brazil . having lost his man for hull 's winner at loftus road , as well as ending up kneeing a chance to cancel it out , ferdinand 's fellow pundit in rio , alan shearer , took almost too much pleasure in pointing out where he 'd gone wrong . he reminded us that rio had said out there that he was not a fan of zonal marking , then gleefully added he clearly was n't ` a fan of marking either ' . while of his miss , the old no 9 shook his head forlornly and said ` all the practise we put in on copacabana beach ' . all this though , as you 'd expect , with a twinkle in the eye . but those samba days of summer clearly worked as a benchmark for the new approach to this match of the day season . to underline that point , it was ruud gullit who was tasked with filling the chair vacated by alan hansen . there will be many who feel that simply removing hansen 's overbearing personality would be enough to give match of the day its ` new look ' . but you ca n't just have an empty chair . tv pals : shearer -lrb- far left -rrb- and ferdinand -lrb- second left -rrb- were part of the bbc 's world cup punditry team . conflicting ideas : ruud gullit -lrb- left -rrb- and shearer -lrb- right -rrb- did n't always see eye-to-eye on decisions . gullit clearly did n't find it a big seat to fill . he became part of the team in south america , and it showed on saturday night . first of all , he dovetailed nicely with his geordie counterpart . and finally , finally , was doing so at least in part because now both pundits shared their opinions on all the games . that abstract system of letting one man talk as the other sat mute is now hopefully a thing of the past . but it was n't all a box of chocolates between them . when discussing the kyle naughton penalty and subsequent red card at upton park , it got a bit tasty . gullit stood his ground by stating ` it 's the rules ' , but shearer chipped away stating the ref ` should show common sense ' . they smiled benignly at each other on set , but i bet they carried on that little tete a tete after the lights had dimmed . it was certainly what the dj 's amongst us might call the right vibe . seeing red : gullit and shearer disagreed over the dismissal of tottenham 's kyle naughton -lrb- second right -rrb- . correct decision ? naughton -lrb- centre -rrb- was sent off for deliberate handball at west ham on saturday . and what of the guv 'n or ? i 've often pointed out that gary lineker is one of the best sports anchors we 've got . and the fact he was a top notch pro in his previous career is most certainly the icing on the cake . on saturday night , though , he reminded us he is none too shabby in the role of journalist , either . although , granted , crystal palace 's co-chairman steve parish is a bit of a gaping net as he seems an affable , open man . nevertheless - in the innovation introduced last season of gary capturing an interview post match with a figure in the headlines - the host pushed the envelope just a little further than i seem to remember him doing before . one of the best : gary lineker is regarded as one of britain 's best sporting presenters . nice touch : lineker demonstrated his journalistic skills in his interview with steve parish -lrb- centre -rrb- . questions about tony pulis such as ` perhaps he thought there was a better job out there ? ' , ` do you feel let down ? ' and then saying ` worth an ask ' before enquiring who would be his replacement , may seem obvious . but in the more comfortable , perhaps sterile atmosphere of match of the day in , say , its thirties and forties , i do n't think they would have been asked . and luckily for us all , so honestly and interestingly answered . which in part may just be because people do n't want to let gary down ? they want to tell him the truth . a good trick in our game if you can pull that off ! and so we 're off and running again and match of the day is looking more than match fit at the grand old age of fifty . and perhaps this is just the right season for it to suck in its gut , trim the nose hairs and not buy its shirts from the supermarket . al reckoned on saturday night that ` it 's thirteen teams that could go down ' . while ruud described the premier league as now being ` not weaker -lrb- but -rrb- interesting . ' well here 's to match of the day echoing those words throughout its half century .	 match of the day kicked off show 's 50th anniversary on saturday .   broadcast was first without tv pundit alan hansen , since his retirement .   alan shearer let rip into qpr 's rio ferdinand defending .   shearer and fellow pundit ruud gullit disagreed over tottenham 's kyle naughton dismissal against west ham .   gary lineker showcased why he is one of britain 's best sport presenters . 
251	manchester city face roma at the stadio olimpico in a match which could end their dream of winning their first champions league trophy . manuel pellegrini 's side have to better cska moscow 's result against bayern munich if they are to make it through to the last-16 . here jamie redknapp analyses how manchester city can claim all three points against their italian opponents . get ready for the midfield general . daniele de rossi is an old-fashioned fighter of a midfielder . he plays with great aggression and i love the way he has stuck with roma . there must be something about the club that makes players want to stay . like his captain francesco totti , 31-year-old de rossi is a one-club man and the fans love him for it . before him i liked watching giuseppe giannini , who spent 15 years at roma , and i almost went there myself when giannini left . de rossi loves snapping into tackles and he 's good in possession . he is one of the finest defensive midfielders in europe but city must be careful not to show him too much respect . if they do then he is capable of the kind of dominant display that will whip the crowd into a frenzy . roma midfielder daniele de rossi is idolised at the italian giants due to his commitment to the club . italian international de rossi has turned down several moves to leave roma throughout his career . attacking options could be risky . sergio aguero has carried city at times this season but with him injured , manuel pellegrini faces a selection headache . does he stick to his principles and play two up front or does he put an extra man in midfield ? pellegrini tends to be quite stubborn in the way he plays and though edin dzeko can lead the line alone , he does n't offer enough defensively . city must win so pellegrini might be tempted to go with dzeko and stevan jovetic , but being too open is a big risk . sergio aguero has been ruled out of manchester city 's champions league clash against roma . manchester city forward aguero is expected to be out for up to six weeks after sustaining a knee injury . beware the king of rome . surely a 38-year-old should not be capable of affecting a game of this magnitude ? think again . francesco totti is a living legend at roma . the fans worship the ground he walks on and he is playing in his theatre . it might be a cliche to call totti a gladiator but that 's how the fans see him . he is battle-hardened , and he knows just what it takes to win a game like this . he has never had to rely on speed because his brain is always one step ahead . he scored roma 's goal in the 1-1 draw at the etihad and this game could be decided by a single moment of genius . that 's why totti is such a threat -- we know he is more than capable of producing one . roma captain francesco totti will lead his side out against manchester city on wednesday night . totti trains alongside roma team-mates miralem pjanic and de rossi during a pre-match training session . yanga-mbiwa could leave roma in ruins . there is no guarantee he will play , but one man i would like to see starting for roma is mapou yanga-mbiwa . he is a complete liability -- he is always likely to pick up a booking and is a mistake waiting to happen . and who did he concede four against on his debut for newcastle last season ? man city . they could do with a repeat performance from the centre half . manchester city may look to target roma centre half mapou yanga-mbiwa during the match in rome . which gervinho will turn up ? the problem with gervinho is he is so hit and miss . yes , he 's an improved player since he left arsenal , where we did n't see the best of him , but if he lashes one in the top corner one week , the next it will end up in row z . but that 's why he 's so dangerous . city have to be aware of him because if he is switched on , he has the potential to cause them big problems . former arsenal forward gervinho will be out to knock manchester city out of the champions league .	 manchester city will be without the injured sergio aguero for crucial tie .   francesco totti will lead his side out against man city at stadio olimpico .   city have to better cska moscow 's result if they are to progress .

253	liberia plans to prosecute the airline passenger who brought ebola into the u.s. , alleging that he lied on an airport questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person , authorities said on thursday . thomas eric duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to dallas , texas on september 19 . on the form he answered no to every question . among other questions , the form asked whether duncan had cared for an ebola patient or touched the body of anyone who had died in an area affected by ebola . scroll down for video . thomas eric duncan filled out a series of questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to dallas , texas on september 19 . on the form he answered no to every question . liberian nurses carry a dead body suspected of dying from the ebola virus at the roberts field highway on the outskirts of monrovia last week . the country has been blighted with the deadly virus since last year which has spread through west africa , killing close to 4,000 people . ` we expect people to do the honorable thing , ' said binyah kesselly , chairman of the board of directors of the liberia airport authority in monrovia . the agency obtained permission from the ministry of justice to pursue the matter . neighbors in the liberian capital believe duncan become infected when he helped bundle a sick pregnant neighbor into a taxi a few weeks ago and set off with her to find treatment . liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf told cbc today that she was ` very angry ' that mr duncan had left liberia after being exposed to ebola and that his actions were ` unpardonable ' . she said that she hoped no one else would be infected with the virus in the u.s. united airlines , which on wednesday revealed duncan had flown on its flights from brussels to washington dulles and then from dulles to dallas , said it had given a ` thorough cleaning ' to both planes he was on . despite duncan spreading ebola to the united states , a u.n. spokesman believes air travel to and from the west african countries affected by the ebola virus should continue . meanwhile , a leading member of the liberian community in dallas told mailonline that duncan should never have gotten on the plane to the u.s. having been in recent contact with an ebola patient . roslyn seyon said : ` if those reports are true ... i do n't think it was a good idea to get on that plane . ` every person has their own conscience . ` if i was in that position i do n't know what i would do . my own judgement would be not -lrb- to travel -rrb- but that 's just me . ' i think about others , that 's what we call selflessness and if i was in liberia and got infected i would consider being checked and not trying to infect others . ' miss seyon , vice president of the liberian community association of dallas-fort worth , added that she hoped ebola was contained quickly in the u.s. records : a copy of a passenger health screening form filled out by ebola patient thomas eric duncan is seen here . questioned : passengers are questioned about their contact with ebola patients before they are allowed to leave the country . duncan is accused of lying on his questionnaire . stephane dujarric told reporters thursday that ` it 's very important not to isolate these countries ' as it would worsen their political and economic situations . he says aid groups need access to the region . in texas , health officials have reached out to about 100 people who may have had direct contact with the man who brought ebola into the u.s. or someone close to him , a public-health spokeswoman said thursday . none of the people are showing symptoms , but health authorities have educated them about ebola and told them to notify medical workers if they begin to feel ill . the group will be monitored to see if anyone seeks medical care during the three weeks immediately following the time of contact , said erikka neroes , of the dallas county health and human services agency . ebola symptoms can include fever , muscle pain , vomiting and bleeding , and can appear as long as 21 days after exposure to the virus . the disease is not contagious until symptoms begin . it spreads only by close contact with an infected person 's bodily fluids . the 80 people include 12 to 18 who came in direct contact with the infected man , as well as others known to have had contact with them , she said . ` this is a big spider web ' of people involved , neroes said . teams of cleaning crews have been scrubbing four dallas schools attended by children who came in direct contact with mr duncan while he was contagious with ebola . parents have been pulling their kids out of classes as a precaution . the initial group includes three members of the ambulance crew that took duncan to the hospital , plus a handful of schoolchildren . health officials are focusing on containment to try to stem the possibility of the ebola virus spreading beyond duncan , who arrived in dallas on sept. 20 to visit relatives and fell ill a few days later . his sister , mai wureh , identified duncan as the infected man . a dallas emergency room sent duncan home last week , even though he told a nurse that he had been in disease-ravaged west africa . the decision by texas health presbyterian hospital to release duncan could have put others at risk of exposure to ebola before the man went back to the er a couple of days later when his condition worsened . the patient explained to a nurse last thursday that he was visiting the u.s. from africa , but that information was not widely shared , said dr. mark lester , who works for the hospital 's parent company . hospital epidemiologist dr. edward goodman said the patient had a fever and abdominal pain during his first er visit , not the riskier symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea . duncan was diagnosed with a low-risk infection and sent home , lester said . the hospital is reviewing how the situation would have been handled if all staff had been aware of the man 's circumstances . but the diagnosis , and the hospital 's slip-up , highlighted the wider threat of ebola , even far from africa . ` the scrutiny just needs to be higher now , ' said dr. rade vukmir , a spokesman for the american college of emergency physicians . duncan has been kept in isolation at the hospital since sunday . he was listed thursday in serious but stable condition . duncan 's neighborhood , a collection of tin-roofed homes , has been ravaged by ebola . so many people have fallen ill that neighbors are too frightened to comfort a nine-year-old girl who lost her mother to the disease . the 19-year-old pregnant woman was convulsing and complaining of stomach pain , and everyone thought her problems were related to her pregnancy , in its seventh month . no ambulance would come for her , and the group that put her in a taxi never did find a hospital . she died , and in the following weeks , all the neighbors who helped have gotten sick or died , neighbors said . ebola is believed to have sickened more than 7,100 people in west africa and killed more than 3,300 , according to the world health organization . liberia is one of the three countries hit hardest in the epidemic , along with sierra leone and guinea .	 thomas eric duncan filled out questions about his health and activities before leaving on his journey to dallas - he answered no to all of them .   duncan reportedly carried a pregnant woman suffering from ebola to hospital - she died hours later from the virus .   mr duncan is quarantined at texas presbyterian after developing symptoms of ebola last thursday .   his girlfriend , her son and two nephews are quarantined ;

262	a heartbreaking new video of the nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by islamic extremists shows them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the first time . the footage , not released publicly but seen by the mail on sunday , was taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction . more than 250 girls were taken in a raid on their school in chibok , in nigeria 's north-east , on april 14 by boko haram terrorists , who want to impose sharia law on the country . the 270 girls are being held by islamic group boko haram after they were abducted from chibok , in north eastern nigeria . the girls in the video look healthy , but it is understood that fraught negotiations are under way to broker the release several pupils who have fallen ill , including one with a broken wrist . in the video , eight girls , dressed in their home-made school uniforms of pale blue gingham , plead for release as they stand courageously in front of the camera . they are clearly scared , upset and trying to be brave . each of them walks in turn to a spot in front of a white sheet fixed to a crude frame between the trees . four of them can be heard clearly , in their hausa language , stating that they were taken by force and that they are hungry . a tall girl , aged about 18 , says tearfully : ` my family will be so worried . ' another , speaking softly , says : ` i never expected to suffer like this in my life . ' a third says : ` they have taken us away by force . ' the fourth girl complains : ` we are not getting enough food . ' terror leader abubakar shekau released a video of the kidnapped girls praying after their conversion to islam . the video , taken by an intermediary on may 19 , has been shown to president goodluck jonathan . it was intended to serve as ` proof of life ' for the girls and to encourage the president to accede to the terrorists ' demands . two earlier videos showed the girls seated on the ground , dressed in hijabs , reciting the koran , and boko haram leader abubakar shekau declaring he would sell them into slavery , or marry them off to their kidnappers , if members of his sect were not released from prison . pressure from the international community and criticism of the president 's slow response to the kidnapping have led to a series of contradictory pronouncements from his government . ministers have declared they will not negotiate with boko haram , or consider the release of prisoners , while official spokesmen have said ` the window is always open for dialogue ' . deborah peter told us congress members how boko haram killed her family in 2011 and called for the release of the kidnapped girls . at a paris peace summit , several west african countries neighbouring nigeria vowed to join in ` outright war ' against the terrorists . britain , france and america pledged their support and have sent teams of military experts and advisers to the region . intelligence sources have told the mos of several rescue attempts , one involving the release of suspected low-level boko haram members detained without charges or trial . two attempts were aborted at the last minute when the terrorists took fright while delivering a group of girls to a safe location . last week nigeria 's chief of defence alex badeh said the government knew the location of the girls and claimed that police and military had been ` following them ' since the abduction . he refused to divulge details , saying it would put the girls in further danger . martha mark holds up a photograph of her daughter monica who is one of the girls kidnapped by boko haram . sources said mr badeh 's announcement may have been the result of government officials seeing the new , unpublished video . they may have been able to persuade boko haram 's intermediary to provide details of the location . it is believed the hostages have been split into at least four groups . dr stephen davis , an australian who has advised three nigerian presidents on how to negotiate with the country 's militant groups , has spent the past month trying to help free the girls . ` the vast majority of the chibok girls are not being held in nigeria , ' he said . ` they are in camps across the nigerian border in cameroon , chad and niger . i say the `` vast majority '' as i know a small group was confirmed to me to be in nigeria last week when we sought to have them released . ' the nigerian government has been engaged in negotiations with boko haram 's spiritual leader abubakar shekau in a bid to secure the girls ' release . he described how fraught the negotiation process has been . ` one of that small group of girls is ill and we had hoped we might convince the commander of the group holding her that she should be released so we could give her medical treatment , ' dr davis said . ` there are other girls who are not well and we have come close to having them released but their captors fear a trap in which they will be captured in the handover process . ` one girl has what i assume is a broken wrist as they demonstrate to me how she holds her hand . i have been told that others are sick and in need of medical attention . ' a military source said : ` this has been a race against time from the minute they were captured . as soon as the girls left nigerian soil it was always going to be more difficult . ` the government made no attempt at a rescue until a month after they were taken . now the situation gets more serious by the day . ` any sort of attempt to get to them would have to be cleared by the governments of the other nations . ' the heavily armed terror group have moved the girls to a ` safe location ' scathing condemnations of nigeria 's failure to address the menace of boko haram , ever since a proposed peace deal failed last august -- leading to the extension of a state of emergency in three northern states -- continued worldwide last week . us senator robert menendez , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , said nigeria had been ` tragically and unacceptably slow ' to begin a search . others say the clock really being watched by nigerian politicians is not the six weeks and counting since the kidnap but the 11 months to the country 's elections . opposition politician nuhu ribadu has accused the government of ` total failure ' .	 terror group boko haram has released a new video of the kidnapped girls .   the group wants to impose sharia law across nigeria .   the video has been passed to nigerian president goodluck jonathan .   terror experts fear the group may have taken most of the girls out of the country .

264	researchers are rushing to develop a pin-prick test for ebola that could cut life-saving days off the amount of time it takes to confirm cases of the deadly virus . scientists say developing a test for ebola that gives an instant result could be vital is stopping the march of the disease , which has killed more than 4,000 people in west africa so far and is spreading . scientists at tulane university in louisiana are working in conjunction with the viral haemorragic fever consortium in sierra leone on a simple pin-prick test to provide an instant ebola diagnosis . scroll down for video . nurses at ebola treatment centres like this one in monrovia , liberia , could use a rapid diagnostic test that identifies the killer disease in minutes rather than days . airports around the world are introducing thermometer tests to determine whether passengers have symptoms of ebola , such as fever . but the temperature tests do not determine whether a passenger is carrying the deadly disease . dr robert garry , professor of microbiology at tulane , said early diagnosis of the disease is vital when it comes to preventing its spread . under current protocols it can take three days for a blood sample to be tested in a lab which can increase the risk of a patient transmitting ebola to other people . in addition to reducing the wait time for results , the system under development uses a simple pin-prick device that dramatically reduces the chance of healthcare workers suffering needle-stick injuries associated with traditional long syringes . ` everyone has their shoulder to the wheel to get this done , ' dr garry told nola.com . he said his team has been working around the clock to increase the accuracy of the test which is designed to identify the specific proteins associated with the disease . the research is being backed by $ 2.9 million grant . the new system is undergoing a series of tests to determine its accuracy . once his team is convinced the test works , dr garry said it was hoped the us food and drug administration will fast-track authorisation so the test can be deployed at airports and in the field . a rapid system of identifying ebola could help stop the spread of the deadly virus . researchers hope the fda will fast-track their diagnosis test so it can be deployed as quickly as possible . dr garry said he has lost six of his colleagues battling the disease and wants the new test ready as quickly as possible . he said ebola 's arrival in the united states will create a greater urgency for action . liberian man thomas eric duncan in a texas hospital on october 8 after bringing the virus to the united states from africa . nina pham , a nurse who treated duncan , has been confirmed as the second ebola infection in the united states . dr garry said : ' i think it 's pretty clear to people here that we ca n't allow that situation to spiral and spiral and spiral out of control . we 're one people -- we ca n't say it 's happening in one part of the planet and not here . ' the world health organisation says 4,033 confirmed , probable or suspected ebola deaths have now been recorded .	 researchers have received a $ 2.9 million grant to develop a rapid ebola test .   the pin-prick field test will diagnose the killer disease in a matter of minutes .   scientists claim an early diagnosis will help medics counter ebola 's spread .

269	the archbishop of canterbury has criticised energy companies for imposing huge price rises that will hammer struggling families . justin welby said power giants had a ` massive ' moral duty beyond squeezing customers for maximum profit , and challenged the firms to justify their huge increases in bills . the archbishop , himself a former oil executive , said he understood the anger over apparently ` inexplicable ' rises and called on the companies ` to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity ' . sympathy : archbishop of canterbury justin welby said he understood anger over ` inexplicable ' rises . he hit out after british gas announced a 9.2 per cent hike , despite parent company centrica recording a # 2.7 billion profit last year . other suppliers are expected to follow suit . speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday , britain 's most senior cleric said that rises which would add an average # 123 a year to bills were ` a huge moral issue ' for energy firms . archbishop welby 's comments will heap pressure on the government to get tougher on the industry . energy prices have become a major political issue , with labour accusing the government of failing to tackle ` rip-off ' companies , while ministers have said consumers should switch to better deals and even wear jumpers to keep warm . the archbishop called on energy companies to be ` conscious of their social obligations ' and said : ` the impact on people , particularly on low incomes , is going to be really severe in this , and the companies have to justify fully what they are doing . ` i do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable , and i can understand people being angry about it , because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman i know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high . that is the reality of it . ' price rise : profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year . the issue of fuel prices has shot to the top of the political agenda since labour leader ed miliband promised to freeze bills for 20 months if he won the next election , a pledged branded a ` con ' by david cameron . shadow energy secretary caroline flint welcomed the archbishop 's comments , saying : ` the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening . ' archbishop welby said the energy companies had a moral obligation to set prices fairly . he said : ` they have control because they sell something everyone has to buy . we have no choice about buying it . ` with that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society . it is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they do n't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit . ` the social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very , very seriously indeed . ' archbishop welby added that he was concerned that fuel poverty was ` a very severe issue ... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up . it ties in with the food banks and the debt . they are all part of the reality of life for many people today . ' ` the chorus of voices telling this government to act on spiralling energy bills is deafening . ' - shadow energy secretary caroline flint . fuel poverty is defined as when ten per cent or more of a household 's disposable income is spent on adequate heating . following the archbishop 's comments , the mail on sunday discovered that the church of england itself invests heavily in energy firms . accounts show the church owns more than # 7 million worth of shares in centrica and about # 6 million in sse . the church says it uses its investments for ` active engagement ' with companies and their boards to exert a positive influence . british gas 's price rise announced last week follows an 8.2 per cent increase by sse . other ` big six ' suppliers are likely to follow . the hike dismayed campaigners , who said it was a ` big , nasty ' shock for families who would have to choose between eating and heating this winter . but the suppliers all say they have to put up bills in the face of rising costs . sse summed up the position , saying : ` we regret having to put our prices , but the cost of supplying energy is going up : buying it , delivering it to homes and the cost of government taxes all cost more than last year and are outside our direct control . ' archbishop welby , who worked for french firm elf aquitaine and london-based enterprise oil before becoming a vicar in coventry , said he did not have enough evidence to know if the suppliers were too quick to pass on wholesale rises , but slow to pass on price falls . profits at british gas rose 11 per cent last year to # 606 million , and managing director chris weston is expected to net # 2 million in share bonuses this year on top of a # 595,000 salary . archbishop welby pays the energy bills for his lambeth palace flat out of his annual # 74,000 stipend , but most clergy receive less than # 25,000 a year . ` wrong place ' : energy minister greg barker said some planners have been ` too insensitive ' ` can not be at any place at any price ' : minister greg barker . wind farms have scarred the british landscape and turned the public against the renewable energy agenda , an energy minister has conceded . greg barker made the admission as he promised that future projects would be located off-shore . ` we put certain projects in the wrong place , ' the energy and climate change minister said . ` some planners have been too insensitive to the impact on the landscape and it has turned public opinion against the wider renewable agenda . we are very clear about the need to limit the impact on the countryside and landscape . it is quite clear the expansion of the on-shore wind rush is over . ' mr barker 's comments come amid growing political tension over rising household energy bills and a week after it was revealed that a record number of on-shore wind farms have been approved for construction this year . between january and august , 188 were granted planning permission -- a 49 per cent increase on the same period in 2012 . as energy companies continue to lodge applications to take advantage of generous green subsidies , mr barker said britain was on course to meet a target that 20 per cent of electricity must come from sustainable sources by 2020 . but the minister added that he would write to every council , warning they must ban turbines from areas of outstanding natural beauty . he said : ` there 's enough wind projects in the system now so we do n't need to see any more on-shore expansion . the big area for expansion is off-shore , where there is scope for larger projects . ` with those projects in the system or under consideration in the planning process at the moment , it means we have enough to get to our 2020 targets . ` but it can not be at any place and at any price .

' let there be light : the norwegian town of rjukan will receive its first ever rays of winter sunshine this year after locals set up giant mirrors to bounce light onto the town square . clever : people gather in front of the town hall in sunlight which has been reflected by giant mirrors . norwegian engineer and industrialist sam eyde was concerned his workers . were n't getting enough sunshine during the winter months.he . considered the mirror idea but felt they lacked the technology to make . it work so opted instead for the construction of a cable car . in 2006 , a similar project was successfully set up in the village of viganella in northern italy which had suffered from exactly the same problem . a delegation from visited viganella to see how their mirror had transformed people 's lives , and was suitably impressed . in 2006 , a similar project was set up in the village of viganella in northern italy which suffered from the same problem -lrb- left -rrb- and a -lrb- right -rrb- rjukan on the map in norway . after five years of debate , rjukan town council finally agreed to to build the mirrors . they are controlled by a computer to follow the path of then sun , adjusting to the best angle to ensure the town square is bathed in light . solar panels will power equipment to automatically wash the mirrors and move them into position . designers hope the sunshine will revitalise the town during the winter months . a message on the rjukan tourist website states : ` the square will become a sunny meeting place in a town otherwise in shadow . '	 industrial town of rjukan gets no sunshine between september and march .   three giant mirrors or ` heliostats ' have been set up on the mountainside .   they will track the path of the sun and beam light onto the town square .   idea was first suggested 100 years ago but a cable car was built instead .   a similar scheme has been successfully implemented in an italian village .

' scroll down for video . tragic : nina pham , 26 , is fighting for her life after contracting ebola from thomas eric duncan . here she is pictured with her beloved king charles spaniel who is not expected to be destroyed but has been quarantined . caution : a member of the cg environmental hazmat team disinfects the entrance to the residence of a health worker at the texas health presbyterian hospital who has contracted ebola in dallas on sunday . the dog is going to be transported out of the apartment , rawlings told the newspaper . miss pham , who works at texas health presbyterian hospital , caught the virus from thomas duncan - the first ebola sufferer to have been diagnosed in the u.s. rawlings expressed similar concerns about the dog to the wall street journal , saying : ` this dog is an important part of the family to our health care worker . we want to make sure the dog is in a safe place . ' ` we 'll assist with -lsb- getting the dog out -rsb- , ' cg environmental employee brad smith told usa today . ` we have the -lsb- personal protection equipment -rsb- that needs to be worn . ' there was a brief but intense battle last week between health officials and protesters over the life of excalibur , a light brown mixed breed dog belonging to a spanish nursing assistant , teresa romero , and her husband . romero was diagnosed with the deadly virus monday , contracted when she treated a victim who came from sierra leone . miss pham , from fort worth , texas was one of the team of medical staff who treated thomas duncan at the dallas hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week . a hazmat crew cleans outside the apartment . the health care worker was one that cared for patient thomas eric duncan the first person diagnosed with ebola in the united states and to pass away . fight for survival : excalibur , the dog of the spanish ebola patient , is seen in this photograph from last week . the dog was euthanized , despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease . officials from madrid 's regional government got a court order tuesday to euthanize the pet , despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease to humans . by that afternoon , 30 to 40 animal rights activists had taken up positions outside romero 's apartment complex , determined to prevent officials from entering . then romero 's quarantined husband , javier , recruited a veterinarian who hosts a popular radio talk show in a bid to spare his dog 's life . ` i 'm in the hospital and i 'm making a call to all people to help me save my dog excalibur because they want to kill him just like that , without following any procedure , ' mr romero said in a video appeal from his hospital room . within hours , the cause went viral . on twitter , the hashtag -lrb- hash -rrb- salvemosaexcalibur - ` let 's save excalibur ' - was tweeted nearly 400,000 times in 24 hours , making it the social networking site 's second most popular meme worldwide . protest : a dog was photographed with protesters in spain on saturday over excalibur 's death . in an equally short time , a petition set up on the change.org website demanding the dog 's life be saved garnered more than 380,000 signatures , and a second petition gathered 70,000 more . but after refusing the say when the dog would be taken away , the madrid regional government announced wednesday evening that it had euthanized the pet . excalibur was ` sedated beforehand to avoid suffering , ' madrid 's regional health agency said in a statement . the corpse was then ` put into a sealed biosecurity device and transferred for incineration at an authorized disposal facility , ' the statement said . the health agency said that the dog was killed because it posed a risk of transmitting the disease to humans . there is no documented case of ebola spreading to people from dogs . but at least one major study suggests dogs can get the disease without showing symptoms . experts say they are uncertain of what risk that poses to humans . spanish authorities , though , were taking no chances . when the white veterinary van carrying excalibur 's body left the apartment complex wednesday , black plastic covered the outside of the windows . dozens of protesters stood in front of it and forced it to stop , briefly . then baton-wielding police officers beat back the crowd and the van drove away .	 dallas mayor mike rawlings has revealed that a dog belonging to ebola patient nina pham , 26 , is not expected to be put down .   the king charles spaniel is going to be transported out of its owner 's apartment , rawlings said .   last week protesters were outraged when spanish officials euthanized an ebola patient 's dog . 
273	for a man who has made billions from encouraging the world to share , it was a very private event . facebook founder mark zuckerberg married his girlfriend of nine years on saturday -- in a ceremony so secret that even the guests did not know they would be attending a wedding . they turned up at zuckerberg 's # 4.5 million home in palo alto , california , thinking they were there to celebrate priscilla chan 's graduation from her degree in paediatrics . true love : priscilla chan , the new mrs mark zuckerberg , was walked down the aisle last saturday by the couple 's dog beast , a hungarian sheepdog . the couple also wrote their own vows . social media : priscilla chan -lrb- left -rrb- and mark zuckerberg interact regularly on facebook , and mark announced their wedding on his personal timeline . married : the couple have been together for nine years , but did not reveal their engagement . but instead they were greeted by zuckerberg -- who famously always wears jeans and hoodies -- in a navy suit and tie , and his bride in a wedding dress . zuckerberg , 28 , and chan , 27 , spent four months planning the wedding , but had not publicly revealed they were engaged . the only announcement came after the event -- and , of course , appeared on zuckerberg 's facebook page , where he posted a picture of himself and his new wife and changed his relationship status to ` married ' . the day before the wedding , facebook floated on the stock market and his fortune rose to # 12billion . but despite this , zuckerberg 's nuptials remained relatively modest , with # 7.50 meals of mexican food from his favourite local restaurant for the guests , who numbered fewer than 100 . performer : billie joe armstrong , the lead singer for green day , arrived with his wife adrienne in town and carrying a gibson guitar . he provided entertainment for the newlyweds , playing ` my last night on earth ' dessert was a selection of chocolate mice at # 2 each , and the venue was the back garden of his five-bedroom home . it is not known whether the couple , who met at harvard , signed a prenuptial agreement to protect zuckerberg 's fortune in the event of a break-up . if they did not , california divorce law works under the principle of ` community property ' , where anything earned by either party during the marriage is divided 50-50 . ms chan graduated from medical school at the university of california , san francisco , on monday , the same day mr zuckerberg turned 28 . the couple have been together for more than nine years and a source at the wedding said mr zuckerberg designed the ring featuring ' a very simple ruby . ' the guests all thought they were coming to celebrate ms chan 's graduation but were told after they arrived that the event was in fact a wedding . ` everybody was shocked , ' the source said . couple : ms chan and mr zuckerberg met when they studied at harvard and have been together ever since . guests : those invited thought they were attending a party to celebrate ms chan 's graduation . arrival : guests were pictured turning up at the palo alto home on saturday afternoon . mr zuckerberg invited green day lead signer billie joe armstrong to entertain his wedding guests and celebrate the ceremony . a video tmz filmed outside mr zuckerberg 's home reveals that he played ` last night on earth . ' mr armstrong told guests he wrote the song for his own wife . in addition to the live performance by mr armstrong , tmz says guests partied to flo rida , bon jovi and janet jackson . however , the facebook family favorite appeared to be michael jackson . neighbors reported hearing the king of pop more than any other artist . according to a source the timing was not tied to the ipo , since the date the company planned to go public was a ` moving target ' . private : mr zuckerberg is known to be secretive about his personal life despite running a social network . drinks : the facebook founder ordered large amounts of alcohol in anticipation of the party . despite his strong advocacy of online openness and sharing , and scant regard for web users ' desire for privacy , mr zuckerberg has long been secretive about his own personal life . it was not even widely known that the facebook founder was engaged to ms chan , despite the length of their relationship . even after friday 's ipo , mr zuckerberg remains facebook 's single largest shareholder , with 503.6 million shares . and he controls the company with 56 per cent of its voting stock . the site , which was born in a dorm room eight years ago , has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people . flotation : mr zuckerberg opened trading on the nasdaq last friday , the day of facebook 's ipo . mr zuckerberg founded facebook at harvard in 2004 , in a saga which would later become the basis for oscar-winning film the social network . he was named as time 's person of the year in 2010 , aged just 26 . mr zuckerberg grew up in dobbs ferry , new york . despite the hype over friday 's initial public offering , the share price fell flat by closing bell , finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price . millions of new investors will be wary come next week amid fears as the ipo failed to match expectations . however , the slightly underwhelming impact of the big day will do little to dent mr zuckerberg 's mood , considering that he is believed to have landed nearly $ 20billion from the deal . he is not alone in striking it rich from the ipo - other facebook investors to profit include co-founder eduardo saverin and u2 frontman bono .	 guests were told party was meant to celebrate chan 's graduation .   comes just one day after facebook went public in mammoth ipo .   green day frontman billie joe armstrong performed at the wedding . 
274	mother teresa was awarded the nobel peace prize and was beatified by the vatican in 2003 . researchers are calling into question the saintly image of mother teresa after carrying out research into her life . born agnes gonxha in albania , she founded the missionaries of charity and spent much of her life in calcutta , caring for the sick and poor . she was awarded the nobel peace prize and was beatified by the vatican in 2003 , six years after her death - one miracle away from sainthood . but a number of critics have questioned how much of the image is justified . writing in journal studies in religion/sciences , serge larivie and genevieve chenard , say her hallowed reputation does not stand up to scrutiny . prof larivie said : ` while looking for documentation on the phenomenon of altruism for a seminar on ethics , one of us stumbled upon the life and work of one of catholic church 's most celebrated woman and now part of our collective imagination - mother teresa . ` the description was so ecstatic that it piqued our curiosity and pushed us to research further . ' after studying nearly 300 documents on her life , they concluded that a number of issues surrounded the nun were not taken into account by the vatican . these included ` her rather dubious way of caring for the sick , her questionable political contacts , her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received , and her overly dogmatic views regarding , in particular , abortion , contraception , and divorce . ' at the time of her death , mother teresa had opened 517 missions welcoming the poor and sick in more than 100 countries . but these missions have been described as ` homes for the dying ' by doctors visiting several of these establishments in calcutta . doctors observed a significant lack of hygiene , even unfit conditions , as well as a shortage of actual care , inadequate food , and no painkillers . but the authors say the problem is not a lack of money , as the foundation created by mother teresa has raised hundred of millions of pounds . sisters of the missions of charity attend the state funeral for mother teresa in calcutta but critics have sparked controversy claiming her care of the sick was ` dubious ' they also say that following numerous natural disasters in india she offered prayers and medallions of the virgin mary but no direct or monetary aid . but she accepted the legion of honour and a grant from the duvalier dictatorship in haiti , said prof larivee , and although millions of dollars were transferred to the various bank accounts , most of the accounts were kept secret . dr larivie says : ` given the parsimonious management of mother teresa 's works , one may ask where the millions of dollars for the poorest of the poor have gone ? ' he says that her image may have been built upon a meeting in 1968 with the bbc 's malcom muggeridge , an anti-abortion journalist who shared her right-wing catholic values . it was his promotion of her which led to her fame , they say . but whether or not her image is deserved , the authors accept that there are many positives to her reputation . dr larivie said : ` if the extraordinary image of mother teresa conveyed in the collective imagination has encouraged humanitarian initiatives that are genuinely engaged with those crushed by poverty , we can only rejoice . ` it is likely that she has inspired many humanitarian workers whose actions have truly relieved the suffering of the destitute and addressed the causes of poverty and isolation without being extolled by the media . ` nevertheless , the media coverage of mother teresa could have been a little more rigorous . '	 mother teresa founded the missionaries of charity and spent much of her life caring for the sick and poor in calcutta .   but researchers are questioning whether her image is justified . 
275	a dallas county sheriff 's deputy remains hospitalized today with ebola symptoms , more than a week after he went unprotected into the apartment of ` patient zero ' thomas duncan . sgt michael monnig went on wednesday to an urgent-care facility in frisco , texas with his wife , after complaining of stomach problems . the deputy presented at the clinic a week after he visited the dallas home where duncan was staying when he developed ebola symptoms . sgt monnig was at the home to deliver a quarantine order to family members . neither sgt monnig , nor the other two health officials , zachary thompson and christopher perkins with him , were wearing protective clothing or masks despite being in the apartment as cleaning crews were going about their work in full protective gear . sgt monning was given an ebola test at texas health presbyterian hospital in dallas , though results usually take 48 hours and are n't due back until friday night . a possible ebola patient , believed to be dallas county sheriff 's deputy michael monnig , is brought to the texas health presbyterian hospital on wednesday in dallas , texas . the sheriff 's deputy arrives at texas health presbyterian hospital today via ambulance after attending an urgent-care clinic with symptoms . sgt monnig walked into texas presbyterian hosptial today accompanied by medics in hazmat suits . sgt monnig , pictured here with his family , went to an urgent-care facility in frisco , texas on wednesday with ebola-like symptoms . his family said he was simply taking precautions . ` it was pretty scary ' : monnig 's wife recalled the fear she had after learning her husband was in the apartment where duncan took ill and likely relived that fear on wednesday . sgt monnig 's son , logan monnig , told cbs that his father had woken up with ` stomach issues ' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution . logan said family were told by the cdc that their father was not at risk of the virus , as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids . ` we are not expecting him to ' test positive for ebola , said logan . the day after going into the apartment , sgt monnig and his fellow officers were told to bag up the clothes they 'd been wearing . their police cars were also taken out of commission . ` that starts putting question marks in your mind , ' monnig told wfaa in an october 3 report . ` you know when you go home and then the next day you start hearing that equipment is being quarantined or asked to be bagged up , that you had on or were driving . ` then your question is , `` well , what about me ? '' and so those were the questions that were raised . ' now the question is : why was n't monnig warned before entering the home completely without protection ? ` there should be some kind of protocols as far as what kind of a response we 're going to have and what kind of safety equipment we 're going to have , ' christopher dyer , president of the dallas county sheriff 's association , said in the wfaa interview . ` those kinds of things did n't happen . ' monnig 's wife lisa echoed his sentiment . ` it was pretty scary , ' lisa monnig said about the day her husband entered the apartment . ' i was awake until he got home that night . ' no doubt monnig is now feeling that pit in her stomach again as she and her family are forced to wait out the next two days it will take to determine whether monnig managed to catch the dreaded virus . mr duncan , 42 , died on wednesday morning at texas health presbyterian hospital , two weeks after developing symptoms of the virus . sgt monnig told medics at the frisco clinic today that he had been in contact with first victim mr duncan and had not been wearing protective clothing . a firefighter removes red tape from a vehicle parked outside a carenow clinic in frisco , texas on wednesday . frisco fire chief mark piland says the deputy is being treated ` out of an abundance of caution ' a medical team in hazmat suits along with law enforcement rushed to the scene at a carenow clinic in frisco , texas on wednesday after a man turned up with ebola-like symptoms . the person , reportedly a dallas county sheriff 's deputy , was exhibiting ebola symptoms today and claimed to have had contact with patient thomas duncan , who died from the virus on wednesday morning . an ambulance , driven by a firefighter-paramedic wearing a hazmat suit , carries an individual , believed to be a dallas county sheriff 's deputy , with ebola symptoms to a hospital in frisco , texas on wednesday afternoon after the person turned up at an urgent care clinic . the carenow clinic was immediately placed in lock-down because monnig was exhibiting signs of the deadly virus - including feeling sick and appearing flushed with a fever . the cdc told mailonline today that the person is not one of the 48 contacts being monitored , and there is no indication of any direct contact with the initial patient , mr duncan . none of the 48 individuals with verified or possible contact with the patient has shown symptoms , the cdc said today . a father who had taken his teenage son to the clinic to get a flu shot on wednesday told wfaa that the man entered the clinic with his wife , appeared flushed and was hunched over . chuck moreno said that he and his son had self-quarantined in an exam room , put on surgical masks and sprayed themselves with disinfectant . sgt monnig answered yes in a screening questionnaire to a question about travel to west africa and is said to have contact with duncan , referred to as ` patient zero ' . the frisco patient was rushed to texas health presbyterian hosptial by ambulance after turning up at the urgent care clinic on main street . medics at the clinic called 911 at around 12.30 pm to request an ambulance for the patient . a team in hazmat suits and face masks transported the law enforcement officer . a hospital spokesman said : ` texas health presbyterian dallas can confirm today that a patient has been admitted to the emergency room after reporting possible exposure to the ebola virus . ` right now , there are more questions than answers about this case . our professional staff of nurses and doctors is prepared to examine the patient , discuss any findings with appropriate agencies and officials . a second person is exhibiting ebola symptoms in texas today and claimed to have had contact with thomas duncan who died from ebola today . a sign on the door of the apartment where thomas eric duncan stayed with family warns that the unit has been quarantined by the commissioner of health on wednesday . where it began : neither sgt monnig , nor the other two health officials , zachary thompson -lrb- left -rrb- and christopher perkins -lrb- right -rrb- with him , were wearing protective clothing or masks . the two other men are seen here leaving the apartment where patient zero stayed while ill . neither thompson nor perkins have reported any worrisome symptoms . ` we are on alert with precautions and systems in place . at the same time , we are caring for routine cases which are completely separate in operations . ' the clinic was keeping everyone at the center until they are checked out by the cdc - it is unknown how many people were exposed to the patient . all those at the clinic will be transferred to a hospital but it is unclear which medical facility . while no doubt in a fearful and nearvous state now , mr. monnig 's career has often hinged largely on his physical toughness , even more so than most cops . the large-framed monnig once worked as a sort of human punching bag for incoming dallas county police recruits who learned how to use batons by beating monnig . at least that was his job until 2008 , when monnig was temporarily terminated from the police force after getting seriously injured during one of his brutal training sessions . he was unable to work in active duty and the force was apparently not interested in giving him a desk job . concerned son : monnig 's son logan -lrb- pictured -rrb- spoke to reporters outside the family home not long after his father checked himself in with doctors wednesday . logan monnig said he and his family are worried about mr. monnig but said ` we are not expecting him to ' test positive for ebola . a patient attended carenow clinic in frisco , texas today and was rushed to a nearby hospital after presenting with ebola symptoms . the clinic was placed on lockdown until everyone inside can be checked by the cdc . ` your job is basically to get beaten up by recruits , ' cbs dfw said in a 2008 interview about his firing . ` part of it is , ' he replied .

' they went on to dismiss anecdotal support for the effectiveness of homeopathy , and urged health professionals to take account of scientific evidence when informing patients . ` it is not possible to tell whether a health treatment is effective or not simply by considering individuals ' experiences or healthcare practitioners ' beliefs , ' they said . homeopathy is a complementary medicine , the central principle of which is that ` like cures like ' -- that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove them in tiny doses . in england there are several nhs homeopathic hospitals and some gp practices offer the treatment but it is not widely available . the report prompted medical professionals to call for governments to stop legitimising homeopathy . professor john dwyer , an immunologist and emeritus professor of medicine at the university of new south wales , told guardian australia the report was long overdue and said homeopathic treatments should now be ` put away ' once and for all . australia 's national health and medical research council analysed research into the effectiveness of alternative medicines on 68 different conditions , and found ` there is no reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective ' on any of them . he said : ` obviously we understand the placebo effect . we know that many people have illnesses that are short lived by its very nature and their bodies will cure them , so it 's very easy for people to fall in trap that because they did a , b follows .

' hanna visited psychologist and clinical hypnotist felix economakis , at the heath therapy clinic in north london . he said : ` sed is usually caused by a trauma . associated with food - it is often something that has happened as a baby . that the patient has no conscious memory of . ` the fear of food stems from this trauma and the anxiety associated with it . ` by . unlocking the subconscious i can get the patient to process the past . and learn to let go of the fear - detraumatising the experience . felix economakis -lrb- left -rrb- says the results of the therapy are immediately measurable and , with 90 per cent of the sed patients he has worked with , hypnosis treatment has been incredibly effective . ` the hypnosis process takes just over an hour and at the end of the session hanna was able to try several types of new food without anxiety . ` the result of the therapy is immediately measurable and with 90 per cent of the sed patients i have worked with , hypnosis treatment has been incredibly effective . ' hanna said : ` i 'd seen so many dieticians and psychologists before i went for hypnotherapy but nothing had worked . ' i could feel my health deteriorating and i knew i had to do something about it - that 's when i met felix and he told me about hypnotherapy treatments . ` the first thing i ate after the hypnotherapy was a mango - it was so sweet and delicious and it is now my favourite fruit . ` the hypnotherapy treatment was amazing , i was so restricted before and now i can live a normal life . ' i feel so much healthier and i am putting weight on - i have so much more energy and i feel much happier . ' sed is also known as picky eating , fussy eating , food phobia , selective eating , or perseverative feeding disorder . it is more common among those within the autistic spectrum and in combination with obsessive compulsive disorder . it starts in childhood or early adolescence and the . most common cause of sed is a development of extra sensitive taste sensation , which is caused . by an increase in fungiform papilla -- taste buds - throughout childhood . typically . the food preferred by an sed sufferer are ` comfort foods ' -- bland and . refined foods , high in carbohydrates -- such as pizza , cheese and chips , . often from particular brands or food outlets . the types of food will be restricted to ten or less with extreme cases only eating one or two types of food . sed . sufferers can get psychiatric help such as cognitive behavioral therapy . and other treatments for ocd which have been successful .	 hannah suffered severe selective eating disorder from the age of five .   was terrified of all foods other than chips , which she ate for 15 years .   suffered anxiety attacks at the thought of mixing flavours .   her restricted and unhealthy diet caused her to pass out at work .   sought hypnotherapy and , after one session , began to eat new foods .   now her favourite treats are pizza and mango .

287	` myth ' : many of the reported benefits of health supplements have no scientific evidence to support the claims . millions of people who take dietary supplements to ward off cancer may be toying with a ` two-edged sword ' that might do them harm , experts have warned . people were being misled by ` messages from supplement manufactures ' stressing the health benefits of their products , including cancer prevention , according to a team of u.s. scientists . they said there was no good evidence that supplement pills and capsules reduced the risk of cancer in healthy individuals . they pointed out that antioxidants such as beta carotene , and vitamins c and e might even have biological effects that promote cancer . antioxidants are believed to counter the destructive effects of rogue oxygen molecules called free radicals . oxidative stress by free radicals , which attack cell membranes , proteins and dna , has been linked to cancer and heart disease . but the u.s. authors , writing in the journal of the national cancer institute , argue that the supposed benefits of antioxidant supplements are largely a myth . the panel of five experts , led by dr maria elena martinez , from the university of california at san diego , wrote : ` undoubtedly , use is driven by a common belief that supplements can improve health and protect against disease , and that at worst , they are harmless . ` however , the assumption that any dietary supplement is safe under all circumstances and in all quantities is no longer empirically reasonable . ' health supplements are booming in the u.s. , with annual sales estimated at # 18.6 billion , said the scientists , who assessed the evidence relating to several supplements including antioxidants , folic acid , vitamin d and calcium . a number of animal , laboratory and observational studies had appeared to show that dietary supplements could lower cancer risk , they said . however , these findings were not confirmed by the ` gold-standard ' in evidence-based medicine , randomised controlled trials -lrb- rcts -rrb- . alarm : scientists said it is no longer true to assume , at worst , health supplements did no harm after finding some antioxidents can increase chances of cancer . only a small number of rcts had been carried out to test the effectiveness of dietary supplements , said the experts - and several of these had reported increased risks . ` supplementation by exogenous anti-oxidants may well be a two-edged sword , ' the scientists wrote . ` these compounds could , in vivo -lrb- outside the laboratory -rrb- , serve as pro-oxidants or interfere with any number of protective processes such as apoptosis induction . ' apoptosis , or programmed cell death , causes malfunctioning cells effectively to ` commit suicide ' . experimental studies had shown that different tissues with different cancer-triggering pathways may not respond the same way to a particular nutrient . ` in fact , a nutrient may be associated with protection in one tissue and harm in another , ' said the experts . they added that supplement users were ` sometimes quick to discredit caution ' and distrustful of mainstream science which they suspected of being corrupted by links to the drug industry . users may also assume the supplements they bought to be as well regulated as over-the-counter medications . ` these beliefs underscore the need for efforts by scientists and government officials to encourage the public to make prudent decisions based on sound evidence with respect to use of dietary supplements for cancer prevention , ' the scientists concluded . graham keen , executive director of the health food manufacturers ' association , which represents supplement manufacturers , said : ` the vitamin and mineral supplements industry has an exceptional record of both safety and efficacy , in the uk and worldwide . '	 scientists say claims of the benefits of antioxidents made are largely a ` myth '   beta carotene , vitamins c and e might even promote cancer , according to research .

290	women who took ssris antidepressants during pregnancy were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism . mothers-to-be who take antidepressants have an increased risk of having a child with autism , a study has found . u.s. researchers say women who took commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - ssris - were three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism or developmental delays . the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester , they say . researchers from the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public looked at nearly 1,000 mothers and their babies . the study , published online in the . journal pediatrics , looked at data from mother-child pairs in the . childhood autism risks from genetics and the environment -lrb- charge -rrb- study . the researchers divided the data up into three groups - children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder -lrb- asd -rrb- , those with developmental delays and those with typical development . all the children were aged between two to five and of them , 82 per cent of those with autism were boys ,66 per cent with developmental delay were boys , as were 86 per cent of those with typical development . while the study included girls , the substantially stronger effect in boys alone suggests they may be much more susceptible for the effects of ssris in the womb , the researchers concluded . ` we found prenatal ssri exposure was nearly three times as likely in . boys with autism relative to typical development , with the greatest risk . when exposure took place during the first trimester , ' said study author li-ching lee . ` ssri was also elevated among boys with developmental delay , with the strongest exposure effect in the third trimester . ' the effect of the drugs , prescribed for depression , anxiety and other disorders , is particularity pronounced during the third trimester . the ` happy ' hormone serotonin is critical . to early brain development , so the researchers suggest exposure during . pregnancy to anything that influences serotonin levels can have . potential effect on birth and developmental outcomes . with diagnoses of autism on the rise , they suggest increased use of ssris in recent years may be contributing to this . commenting on the study , irva hertz-picciotto , chief of the division of . environmental and occupational health at uc davis , said : ` this study provides further evidence that in some children , prenatal exposure to ssris may influence their risk for developing an autism spectrum disorder . ` this research also highlights the challenge for women and their physicians to balance the risks versus the benefits of taking these medications , given that a mother 's underlying mental-health conditions also may pose a risk , both to herself and her child . '	 the effect of the drugs is particularity pronounced .   during third trimester .   researchers suggest rising rates of autism and ssri use may be linked . 
291	the united nations sparked fury today after launching an unprecedented inquiry into britain 's treatment of the disabled . the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities launched a formal probe into whether this country has committed ` grave or systemic violations ' of the rights of disabled people . tory mps tonight branded the investigation ` politically motivated ' and said britain 's record on help for disabled people was among the best in the world . scroll down for video . a spokesman for iain duncan smith 's work and pensions department said the uk spends # 50 billion a year on disabled people . the focus on britain for the latest inquiry raised eyebrows given the other countries represented on the committee . its members include uganda , kenya , thailand , and tunisia . the investigation is the latest in a series of interventions into british domestic policy by the united nations , which have provoked fury among ministers . earlier this year a group of un poverty ` ambassadors ' attacked government welfare reforms , and last year the un 's controversial brazilian housing ` rapporteur ' raquel rolnik , a former marxist dubbed the ` brazil nut ' , criticised cuts to housing benefit . tory mp michael ellis said : ` this politically motivated loony left decision brings the un organisation in to disrepute . ` at a time when there are grave international crises around the world and when in dozens of countries around the world there are no benefits available , this absurd decision is made to attack our country which rightly does more than almost any other to protect the rights of disadvantaged people from all walks of life . ' brazilian un poverty ambassador raquel rolnik criticised the british government 's ` bedroom tax ' earlier this year - sparking anger among tory mps . fellow conservative philip davies said : ` these people at the un are idiots , frankly . there 's no other way to describe them . ` this country has led the way in the support and rights that we give to disabled people -- such as through the disability discrimination act which was passed by a conservative government in 1995 . ` if the un drew up a list of countries in the world showing how much they gave to disabled people they would find the uk was the highest in the world . ` they are exposing the un for the completely useless organisation that it is . ' the investigation is officially confidential , but a former member of the committee confirmed its existence in a video posted on the internet . professor gabor gombos told a conference in galway , ireland : ` where the issue has been raised and the government did not really make effective actions to fix the situation ... it is a very high threshold thing , the violations should be grave and very systemic . ' the existence of the inquiry , which was reported by disability news service . the committee did not respond to requests by the mail for comment , but jorge araya , the committee 's secretary , told dns : ` inquiry proceedings ... of the optional protocol to the united nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities , are confidential . ' miss rolnik sparked a furious reaction from work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith after she criticised the so-called ` bedroom tax ' . she also signed a letter from a group of poverty ` ambassadors ' criticising other welfare reforms designed to cut britain 's huge benefits bill and encourage unemployed people back in to work . another un inspector , south african feminist academic rashida manjoo , was crticised after she claimed britain had a culture of sexism worse than any other country in the world . the department for work and pensions also refused to comment on the inquiry , but pointed out the uk spends around # 50billion a year on disabled people . a spokesman said : ` all united nations inquiry processes are confidential . must . ` this government is committed to supporting disabled people and we continue to spend around # 50bn a year on disabled people and their services .

294	a 22-year-old dutch woman 's ear turned black after she was bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider in italy . a dutch woman 's ear turned black after she was bitten by a poisonous spider in italy . part of the 22-year-old 's ear was liquefied by the mediterranean recluse spider 's venom and the skin and cartilage died . the woman 's experience is thought to be the first evidence that recluse spider venom can destroy cartilage . the patient 's health problems began when she woke up with a painful ear one morning , livescience reports . her ear swelled up so , unaware she had been bitten by a spider , she visited a local hospital where she was given antihistamine . despite this treatment , the swelling and pain failed to subside . by the time she returned to the netherlands , part of her ear had turned back indicating the cells had died . the woman sought medical help and doctors realised she had been bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider as the creature 's venom is known to kill skin . however , dr marieke van wijk , a plastic surgeon involved in the patient 's care , explained this was the first time doctors had seen the spiders ' venom destroy cartilage as well as skin . the spiders ' venom kills cells using a complex mixture of chemicals which break down proteins and there is no drug treatment that is known to be effective . as a result , dr van wijk and her colleagues were forced to remove the dead tissue from the woman 's ear and then rebuild it using cartilage from her ribs . the mediterranean recluse spider originated in the mediterranean region of north africa and europe but it is now widely distributed . it has poisonous venom but is thought only to bite when forced into contact with people - for example , if trapped in clothes or bedding . in rare cases , the spiders ' bites can be fatal as they can cause kidney failure . the spider 's venom liquefied part of the woman 's ear and caused some of the skin and cartilage to die . the dead tissue had to be cut away -lrb- left -rrb- and then the ear had to be rebuilt using cartilage from her ribs -lrb- right -rrb- . normally , bites cause a red patch to develop on the skin which leaves a slow-healing , open wound and exposed muscle . it can take up to two months for the wound to heal and it often leaves a sunken scar . dr van wijk told livescience that the spiders are ` not that dangerous ' and that she ` would n't take precautions ' to avoid a bite . the case was reported in the journal of plastic , reconstructive and aesthetic surgery .	 the dutch woman , 22 , was bitten by a mediterranean recluse spider in italy .   part of her ear was liquefied by the venom and the skin and cartilage died .   this is the first evidence the spiders ' venom can destroy cartilage .   the dead tissue had to be cut away before her ear could be rebuilt .

' there are 800,000 people living with dementia in the uk - a figure expected to rise to a million by 2021 . the report is one of the first comprehensive long-term studies looking at the effect of key risk factors for heart disease and stroke on brain function . altogether 3,330 18 to 30-year-olds had their blood pressure , fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels checked every two to five years . researchers analysed each person 's cumulative cardiovascular health over 25 years . at the end of the study , published in the journal circulation , the participants took three tests measuring memory , thinking speed and mental flexibility . researchers found those with healthier levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol in their 20s had better brain function 25 years later . those with blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol levels slightly higher than recommended guidelines when they were young , had lower scores in cognitive function tests in their 40s and 50s . the average differences found , although small , were considered statistically significant by the researchers . elevated blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol are three major risk factors for atherosclerosis , the slow narrowing of arteries caused by a build-up of plaque in the artery walls leading to the brain and heart . dr yaffe said the narrowing of the arteries leading to and in the brain was the most likely explanation for the link between cardiovascular health and cognitive function . she said : ` our study is hopeful , because it tells us we could maybe make a dent in the risks of alzheimer 's and other forms of dementia by emphasising the importance of controlling risk factors among younger people . ' previous research suggests that eating a mediterranean diet can help prevent memory loss and may stave off alzheimer 's . the diet rich in plant foods and fish , and low intake of red meat , appears to improve vascular function , the flexibility of cells lining the walls of blood vessels , which help keep arteries supplying heart and brain healthy . dr simon ridley , head of research at alzheimer 's research uk , said : ` there is mounting evidence to suggest that keeping healthy when we are younger may help preserve memory and thinking skills in later life . ` previous research has shown that high blood pressure , high blood sugar and raised cholesterol may all be linked to an increased risk of dementia . ` while there 's currently no certain way to prevent dementia , evidence suggests that eating a healthy diet , doing regular exercise , not smoking , not drinking too much and keeping blood pressure in check could help reduce the risk of the condition . ` research to build a more detailed picture of the risk factors for dementia is vital , as the better we understand these factors , the more able we will be to take action to lower our risk . ` if we could delay the onset of alzheimer 's , the most common cause of dementia , by five years , we could halve the number of people living with the disease - that means investment in research is crucial .

'' groening 's lawyer , hans holtermann , refused to comment on the charges . he was never punished after the war , a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948 , but groening who worked as the manager of a glass factory has openly talked about his time as a guard and said that he witnessed atrocities . the main gate of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz i , near oswiecim , poland , which was liberated by the russians in january 1945 . writing on the gate reads : arbeit macht frei -lrb- work sets you free - or work liberates -rrb- . a group of ss officers gathered in front of a building at solahutte , the ss retreat outside of auschwitz , poland . from left , josef kramer , dr. josef mengele , richard baer , karl hoecker and an unknown officer . ss officers socialising in the grounds of their retreat , solahutte outside of auschwitz , poland . from left , dr josef mengele , rudolf hoess -lrb- the former commandant of auschwitz -rrb- , josef kramer -lrb- commandant of birkenau -rrb- , and an unknown officer . nine years ago , he was interviewed by der spiegel and told the magazine of one incident when he heard a baby crying : `` i saw another ss soldier grab the baby by the legs ... he smashed the baby 's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent . ` on one night in january 1943 i saw for the first time how the jews were actually gassed . it was in a half-built farmyard near to the auschwitz-birkenau camp . a gas chamber was built there . the women 's barracks in the auschwitz concentration camp in oswiecim . all that remains : a pile of shoes from prisoners at the auschwitz museum near former death camp auschwitz . ` there were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut . ` then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook zyklon b gas pellets inside . in that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo , a choir of madness . these cries i have ringing in my ears to this day . members of the ss helferinnen -lrb- female auxiliaries -rrb- and ss officer karl hoecker sit on a fence railing in solahutte eating bowls of blueberries in auschwitz . ` it was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber , although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work . many jews knew they were going to die . ' ' i made an application for a transfer and at the end of october 1944 i was shipped to the belgian ardennes where i served with a fighting unit until capture . ' groening , who lives near the lueneburg heath in lower saxony , is one of around 30 former auschwitz guards who federal investigators recommended last year that state prosecutors pursue charges against under a new precedent in german law . reichsführer heinrich himmler was buried in an unmarked grave at lueneburg heath after his suicide in may 1945 , following his capture by the british . groening is the fourth case investigated by hanoverian authorities -- two have been abandoned because the suspects are unfit for trial , and one was closed when the suspect died . herr holtermann said , however , his client is in good health . thomas walther , who represents 20 auschwitz victims and their families as co-plaintiffs in the case against groening as allowed under german law , said it 's their last chance `` to participate in bringing justice to one of the ss men who had a part in the murder of their closest relatives . '' `` many of the co-plaintiffs are among the last survivors of auschwitz .

298	health risk : painkillers used by millions of britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke -lrb- file picture -rrb- . painkillers used by millions of britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke . the extra chance of developing atrial fibrillation is as high as 84 per cent , dutch researchers say . the condition -- a leading cause of first-time strokes -- means the upper chambers of the heart are out of rhythm and beat much faster than normal , which allows blood to pool and clot . at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -lrb- nsaids -rrb- such as diclofenac and ibuprofen , and newer medication called coxibs . in the study , the heart health of 8,423 people aged 55 and older was tracked since 1990 in rotterdam . cases of atrial fibrillation were diagnosed using heart tracer recordings , while the details of drugs prescribed were gathered from pharmacies . the average age of the study participants was 68 , and just over half were women , says a report in the online journal bmj open . during the average monitoring period of just under 13 years , 857 participants developed atrial fibrillation . of these 261 had never used nsaids when they were diagnosed , while 554 had used nsaids in the past , and 42 were currently taking these drugs . current use was associated with a 76 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation than for those who had never taken nsaids . age , sex and underlying heart problems were taken into account . use of the painkillers within the preceding 30 days was linked to an 84 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation . while there was a trend for higher doses to be linked to higher atrial fibrillation risk , the finding was not statistically significant . anti-inflammatory : at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers , including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -lrb- nsaids -rrb- such as diclofenac and ibuprofen -lrb- pictured -rrb- . it is thought nsaids may contribute to heart rhythm problems by increasing blood pressure as a result of fluid retention . bruno stricker , of the erasmus medical centre in rotterdam , said previous research had thrown up a link between atrial fibrillation and these painkillers . ` our results also suggest that the increased risk occurs shortly after starting treatment and may disappear over time , ' he added . nsaids work by blocking the cox-2 enzyme which reduces pain and inflammation , but is also important in regulating heart function . there were 17million prescriptions for nsaids in the uk in 2010 . ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with voltarol tablets containing diclofenac but at far lower doses than on prescription . around ten years ago the anti-arthritis drug vioxx was voluntarily taken off the market because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes . professor colin baigent , of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at oxford university , said : ` this study is consistent with previous reports indicating that some nsaids increase the risk of atrial fibrillation . ` atrial fibrillation is just one of several cardiac hazards associated with nsaids , the most important of which is an increased risk of heart attacks . on sale : there were 17million prescriptions for nsaids in the uk in 2010 . ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets , along with voltarol tablets -lrb- pictured -rrb- containing diclofenac . ` although nsaids are very effective for . the treatment of pain , it is important that both risks and benefits are . considered carefully before they are prescribed . ' oxford researchers last year found that high doses of nsaids can increase the risk of heart attacks , strokes and heart failure . their study confirmed the existence of a ` small but significant ' extra risk of dying from heart problems after prolonged use . the research , published in the lancet medical journal , found naproxen was the safest nsaid . researchers looked at the highest doses of painkillers prescribed by doctors , twice the daily amount recommended for headache and other minor ailments . they said a short course of tablets bought over the counter for a muscle sprain was unlikely to be hazardous . the study pooled the findings from 639 trials after numerous small trials showed a link between nsaids and heart side effects .	 painkillers may raise risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger stroke .   extra chance of developing atrial fibrilliation as high as 84 % , says study .   condition means the upper chambers of the heart do not beat in rhythm .   it is leading cause of first-time strokes as it allows blood to pool and clot .   at least seven million britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers .

305	revelations : in a bombshell email to the mos sir richard dearlove threatened to reveal new details behind the ` dodgy dossier ' scandal . a former head of mi6 has threatened to reveal explosive new details behind the ` dodgy dossier ' scandal if he objects to the long-awaited findings of the chilcot inquiry into britain 's role in the iraq war . sir richard dearlove , 68 , who provided intelligence about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- that was apparently ` sexed up ' by tony blair 's government , has spent the last year writing a detailed account of events leading up to the war . he had intended to keep his work under lock and key and made available only to historians after his death . but now sir richard has revealed to the mail on sunday that he could go public after the chilcot inquiry publishes its findings . sir richard is expected to face censure from the inquiry 's chairman , sir john chilcot , over the accuracy of intelligence provided by mi6 agents inside iraq -- which was used in the so-called ` dodgy dossier ' . in a bombshell email to the mail on sunday , sir richard , who is master at pembroke college , cambridge university , disclosed : ` what i have written -lrb- am writing -rrb- is a record of events surrounding the invasion of iraq from my then professional perspective . ` my intention is that this should be a resource available to scholars , but after my decease -lrb- may be sooner depending on what chilcot publishes -rrb- . i have no intention , however , of violating my vows of official secrecy by publishing any memoir . ' sources close to sir richard say that while he accepts that some of mi6 's information on the wmds was inaccurate , he insists that chilcot should recognise the role played by tony blair and the prime minister 's chief spokesman alastair campbell in informing media reports which suggested saddam could use chemical weapons to target british troops based in cyprus -- a claim which put britain on a path to war in iraq . mr blair and mr campbell have repeatedly denied making misleading statements about wmd . but sir richard is said to remain extremely aggrieved that this piece of intelligence , which his agents stressed only referred to battlefield munitions which had a much shorter range , led to media reports that uk bases were under threat . last week it was revealed that sir john had written to prime minister david cameron informing him of his intention to write personally to those individuals he intends to criticise , with reports suggesting that tony blair is among those on sir john 's list . sir richard has taken a sabbatical from his duties at cambridge university to research and write his record of events . with his account nearing completion , he is expected to resume his master 's role at the start of the new academic year . a security source told the mail on sunday : ` this is sir richard 's time-bomb . he wants to set the record straight and defend the integrity of mi6 . ` and sir richard has taken a lot of personal criticism over mi6 's performance and his supposedly too-cosy relationship with mr blair . in flames : british soldiers under attack in the iraqi town of basra in 2004 . ` no chief of mi6 has done anything like this before , but the events in question were unprecedented . ` if chilcot does n't put the record straight , sir richard will strike back .

' ` we 're tories , we believe in low taxes . and believe me -- we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people . ' david cameron . tory strategists believe mr miliband made a major blunder in his speech last week by shifting decisively to the left , proposing 1970s-style price fixing in the energy market , state seizures of undeveloped land and penalties for businesses who fail to take on trainees . in his 50-minute address , mr cameron said labour had comprehensively lost the economic argument and it was clear to all that the economy was ` turning the corner ' . he said : ` there was a time when i 'd look across to ed balls and he was shouting his head off , screaming that the economy was flatlining with such glee . ` but recently , it 's gone a bit quiet . could it be because there was no double dip and the economy 's growing ? ' key note speech : mr cameron and his wife samantha wave to crowds following his address . mr cameron said the last government had left behind a ` casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system ' . business , he pointed out , had already created 1.4 million new jobs since the last election and must be helped , not deterred . ` profit , wealth creation , tax cuts , enterprise : these are not dirty , elitist words -- they 're not the problem , they are the solution , because it 's not government that creates jobs , it 's businesses . ` you do n't do this job to be popular . you do it because you love your country . i do the best i can . ' david cameron . ' i know that bashing business might play to a labour audience . but it 's crazy for our country . ' mr cameron said he knew voters were asking whether the ` struggle ' of the past few years of austerity had all been worth it . he said : ` here 's the honest answer : the struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we 've started . ' to abandon deficit reduction now would throw away ` all the progress we 've made ' , the prime minister insisted . ` how did they -lsb- labour -rsb- get us into this mess ? ` too much spending , too much borrowing , too much debt . and what did they propose last week ? ` more spending , more borrowing , more debt . reprise : mr cameron 's speech echoed a 1987 speech from then pm margaret thatcher . history repeating ? the tories last won an election outright with a similar sentiment - one that saw john major 's conservatives beat off a challenge from neil kinnock 's labour party . ` they have learned nothing -- literally nothing -- from the crisis they created . ' he dismissed mr miliband 's promises to cut the cost of living as ` all sticking plasters and quick fixes ' . acknowledging spending cuts had been unpopular , mr cameron added : ` you do n't do this job to be popular . you do it because you love your country . i do the best i can . ` labour have learned nothing -- literally nothing -- from the crisis they created . ' david cameron . ` and for me it comes back to some simple things -- country first , do what 's decent , think long-term . ' it was not enough simply to clean up labour 's economic ` mess ' and pay off the deficit , he said , the conservatives wanted to ` build something better in its place ' . the conservative leader also sought to march onto centre-ground territory , where his party has traditionally found it difficult to make inroads against labour -- promising to drive industrial regeneration in the north of england and positioning the tories as the true defenders of the nhs . listening : -lrb- left-right -rrb- michael gove , theresa may , and george osborne listen intently to mr cameron 's speech . support : william hague , iain duncan smith and jeremy hunt applaud following mr cameron 's speech . after the scandal of the mid-staffordshire hospital trust , where hundreds of patients died , the conservatives would take no lectures from labour on the nhs , he said . he even praised the ` noble calling ' of social work -- promising to get more top-flight graduates into the profession . and the prime minister sought to assure tory troops that he is fighting for a majority tory government , not another power-sharing administration with the lib dems . john cridland , head of the . confederation of british industry , said mr cameron had ` sent out a . strong message about how vital british business is to the future . prosperity of people across the uk ' . but labour vice-chairman michael dugher said : ` there 's a cost-of-living crisis and he 's got nothing to say about it . ` rather . than standing up for hard-working people he has always puts a . privileged few first , prioritising a tax cut for those earning over . # 150,000 while everyone else pays more . ' mr cameron was joined by wife samantha on stage as his audience gave him a standing ovation . the . pair left the auditorium to the sound of fleetwood mac 's do n't stop . thinking about tomorrow , used by bill clinton during his successful . campaign in 1992 . focus : the conservatives are already turning their attention towards the next election . job done : walking hand-in-hand with wife samantha , david cameron looks pleased with his speech as he shakes the hand of a supporter . margaret thatcher was the greatest peacetime prime minister britain ever had , david cameron said yesterday . conservatives this year ` said goodbye to one of our team , ' he told a packed hall at the party conference in manchester . he hailed the achievements of the late baroness thatcher , who died in april this year . greatest : margaret thatcher memorabilia on sale at this year 's tory party conference . mr cameron said : ` margaret thatcher made our country stand tall again , at home and abroad . ' he went on to list some of her many achievements : ` rescuing our economy , giving power to our people , spreading home ownership , creating work , winning the cold war , saving the falklands . ' he also revealed how he had sat next to her at dinner once and had been very nervous to speak to her . mr cameron asked her about her record and told how she had been ` totally charming ' and had ` put me at ease ' . but when he asked the iron lady what she would do differently if she had her time in government again , she replied : ` you know , i think i did pretty well the first time around . ' mr cameron added : ` we can all agree with that and we can all agree with this -- she was the greatest peacetime prime minister our country has ever had . '	 the pm scoffed at what he called ` red ed and his blue peter economy '   voters asked for chance to ` finish the job ' of turning britain around .   he described the prospect of a labour government as a ` land of despair '   echoing major and thatcher , cameron spoke of ` land of opportunity for all '   the under-25s may be stripped of state benefits unless they ` earn or learn '   mr cameron conceded it was a mistake to ignore grass-roots opposition and force through gay marriage laws .   lord heseltine branded ukip ` racists ' and warned tories to scrap ideas of an electoral deal . 
313	sixty per cent of the public believe immigration has damaged britain , a major poll revealed last night . the study , commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft , reveals widespread concern about the scale of immigration and its impact on jobs and public services . just one person in six -lrb- 17 per cent -rrb- believes that the advantages of immigration have outweighed the disadvantages . ineffective : a government initiative to reduce immigration that was deemed unlikely to work . many of the 20,000 people polled also reported direct experience of losing out to immigrants in the competition for a job or public services such as housing . overall , it was identified as the second most important issue facing britain after the state of the economy . lord ashcroft said the study revealed deep concerns about immigration , coupled with scepticism that any of the political parties would deal with the problem . ` many feel that over the past 15 years immigration has been allowed to happen on a scale we can not cope with , and without public consent being sought or given , ' he said . ` politicians underestimated the size of the challenge , lost control of the situation , refused for too long to acknowledge that any problems might result , and are now struggling but failing to cope . ` most -lsb- of the public -rsb- do not feel there is any strategy for dealing with the number of migrants and their successful integration into british society , or for managing the effects on housing , infrastructure , jobs , the nhs , schools or the benefits system . ' more than three-quarters of people -lrb- 77 per cent -rrb- said they supported a ` drastic ' reduction in immigration , saying it would make it easier for british people to find jobs and reduce the pressure on public services . the controversial vans have been passing through ealing , barking and dagenham , hounslow , redbridge , brent and barnet . pictured - one of the billboards in southall , west london . more than one-third -lrb- 36 per cent -rrb- said that they or a family member had found it harder to get work because of competition from immigrants , and almost a quarter -lrb- 24 per cent -rrb- said they or a family member had lost out to immigrants in the queue for council housing or other public services . women were more hostile to immigration , with just 14 per cent saying immigration had been a good thing , compared to 21 per cent of men . and there were clear differences between supporters of the political parties . some 62 per cent of tory voters thought immigration had damaged britain , compared to 48 per cent of labour voters and 39 per cent of lib dems . ninety-one per cent of ukip voters said immigration was damaging britain . the poll also identified differences in class attitudes towards immigration . david cameron has pledged to cut net migration ¿ the difference between numbers entering and leaving britain . middle-aged working-class voters were far more concerned about the issue , with 90 per cent saying it was one of the biggest challenges facing the country . by contrast , graduates working in the public sector were likely to be far more positive about immigration , with 80 per cent saying it had benefited britain . but the poll also revealed some more nuanced attitudes towards immigration . some 83 per cent said they or a family member had been treated by nhs staff from overseas , and 49 per cent said immigrants were willing to do jobs that british workers do not want to do , with 38 per cent saying they also worked harder than their british counterparts . the poll also revealed deep public scepticism about the willingness of the government to deal with the problems produced by immigration . a controversial home office poster campaign warning illegal immigrants to ` go home or face arrest ' was supported by 79 per cent of people , but only 17 per cent think it will work while just 37 per cent of people think illegal immigrants already in the country are ever likely to face deportation . david cameron has pledged to cut net migration -- the difference between numbers entering and leaving britain -- to under 100,000 from non-eu countries by the time of the next general election in 2015 . but , alarmingly for the prime minister , the study shows most people are not aware of government initiatives to bring about this reduction . the poll found that 76 per cent of people supported an annual cap on non-eu immigration but only 34 per cent knew it had taken place . there was also widespread support for other initiatives , such as cracking down on bogus colleges that grant places to immigrants pretending to be students , toughening requirements for immigrants to speak english and making it harder for people to bring in spouses from outside europe , but in each case a majority of people was unaware that action had already been taken .	 the study was commissioned by former tory treasurer lord ashcroft .   just one in six believe advantages of immigration outweigh the disadvantages .

' one disgusted view said : ` it is a horrible advert , totally repellent , and i do not understand why anyone would be compelled to buy life insurance from this company . ` also , although i do see that the monster in the corner is squirting water from the tap at the man in the bath , it looks like he is weeing on him . ` this one ought to be banned - or limited to the horror channel .

317	genius : alan turing , who certainly earned his stripes in the scientific world . for the first time experimental evidence has been put forward confirming great british mathematician alan turing 's theory of how biological patterns such as tiger stripes or leopard spots are formed . turing , whose centenary falls this year , put forward the idea that regular repeating patterns in animals are generated by a pair of morphogens that work together as an ` activator ' and ` inhibitor ' . now researchers from king 's college in london have validated the famous code-breaker 's 60-year-old theory in tests that also advance regenerative medicine . to test the theory the researchers studied the development of the regularly spaced ridges found in the roof of the mouth in mice . carrying out experiments in mouse embryos , the team identified the pair of morphogens working together to influence where each ridge will be formed . these chemicals controlled each other 's expression , activating and inhibiting production and therefore controlling the generation of the ridge pattern . the researchers were able to identify the specific morphogens involved in this process -- fgf or fibroblast growth factor , and shh , which stands for sonic hedgehog -- so-called because laboratory fruit flies lacking the fly version have extra bristles on their bodies . cat 's amazing : tigers have stripes because of the behaviour of specific morphogens . turing was one of the great unsung heroes of world war ii . he broke the german military 's secret codes - created using the famous enigma machine - that helped british intelligence stay one step ahead of hitler , allowing the navy to defeat his u-boats and win the battle of the atlantic . turing 's work even laid the foundation for the creation of modern computers , leading time magazine to name him one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century . ` everyone who taps at a keyboard , opening a spreadsheet or a wordprocessing program , is working on an incarnation of a turing machine , ' it said . but turing was shamefully ignored by the british establishment , and then killed himself in 1954 after being convicted of being a homosexual and forced to undergo hormone therapy . they showed that when these morphogens ' activity is increased or decreased , the pattern of the ridges in the mouth palate are affected in ways predicted by turing 's equations . for the first time the actual morphogens involved in this process have been identified and the team were able to see exactly the effects predicted by turing 's 60-year-old speculative theory . dr jeremy green from the department of craniofacial development at king 's dental institute said : ` regularly spaced structures , from vertebrae and hair follicles to the stripes on a tiger or zebrafish , are a fundamental motif in biology . t . ` there are several theories about how patterns in nature are formed , but until now there was only circumstantial evidence for turing 's mechanism . our study provides the first experimental identification of an activator-inhibitor system at work in the generation of stripes -- in this case , in the ridges of the mouth palate . ` although important in feeling and tasting food , ridges in the mouth are not of great medical significance . however , they have proven extremely valuable here in validating an old theory of the activator-inhibitor model first put forward by alan turing in the 50s . ` not only does this show us how patterns such as stripes are formed , but it provides confidence that these morphogens -lrb- chemicals -rrb- can be used in future regenerative medicine to regenerate structure and pattern when differentiating stem cells into other tissues . ` as this year marks turing 's centenary , it is a fitting tribute to this great mathematician and computer scientist that we should now be able to prove that his theory was right all along ! ' results of the study were published this week in nature genetics .	 alan turing 's 60-year-old theory is validated .

321	a british man is now claiming scotland 's proudest creation : whisky . entrepreneur daniel szor will soon begin creating whisky - more than 500 miles from one of the homelands of whisky - glenmorangie . entrepreneur daniel szor , 51 , plans to produce ultra-premium , small batch single malt whisky from his plant in the cotswolds . by 2017 , visitors to the area could be enjoying a glass of cotswolds single malt - for the price of # 44.95 per bottle . by then , mr szor aims to have his first run of 5,000 ` single estate ' bottles ready . yet three years before the launch , he is already taking orders of the whisky . mr szor is renovating two cotswolds stone buildings at stourton , near shipston , in warkwickshire to equip as the distillery , tasting rooms and offices . he has also imported a scotsman to help him with the job - master distiller harry cockburn and a wood and ageing consultant , jim swan , has also been brought on board . as well as whisky , the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries . by september this year , mr szor hopes to begin producing his first bottles and in the summer of 2015 gin from the distillery will go on sale . the distillery will also create a rye whisky called traitor 's ford rye after a local landmark associated with the english civil war . mr szor said : ` we are excited to be creating an adventurous new landmark for the region and for english whisky . ' the idea was born out of a passion for single malt . ' i was very much charmed by the scottish and their production . ' i really did n't want to sit behind a desk any more so i thought to myself ` what else can i do ? ' ' i just happened to be looking out of the window at our cotswolds house and i saw a beautiful field full of barley and thought i could distil that , ' he said . and all of the ingredients used in the distillery will be from the cotswolds . the businessman bought his first cast of the spirit in 2002 , at the newly reopened bruichladdich distillery on islay . over time , daniel , who is originally from new york , watched a number of whisky distilleries open , and grow from strength to strength , inspiring him to start his own operation . the label on the bottles will read : ` established 2013 , single malt whisky ' . each bottle will be decorated with a pheasant . a new home for whisky : the cotswolds . mr szor is pictured here in front of the stone buildings in stourton , warwickshire . soon , bottles of cotswolds single malt will begin being released from behind these doors . he plans to use locally sourced ingredients in his production , and has already pre-purchased 20 tonnes of barely from a nearby farm . cotswolds water will also feature as one of the main ingredients , and bottles of both single-malt and gin will be finished off with speciality water bought in from blenheim , oxfordshire . but although scotland is the country behind whisky , mr szor said he does not find its reputation for the drink intimidating , instead , he plans to follow the scottish lead . mr szor aims to have his first 5,000 bottles of costwolds single malt ready by 2017 . the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries . from the warwickshire site , he hopes to produce around 120,000 bottles of whisky a year . he said : ' i never forget for a day what good quality drinks are being made just a couple of hundred miles north of us . ` what we put out in a year will be what the medium scottish firms put out in a day or two . ` we are looking to build a reputation regionally , to us scotland is not intimidating , it is a road to follow . ' i see a lot of people who want to go off and do their own thing , but i 'm in this to make a product , i need to be able to sell my second bottle as well as my first . ' the szor family is funding the project alongside the cotswolds distillery founders circle - which is offering interested investors an opportunity to take part . scottish version of the spirit is spelled without an ` e ' the irish version takes an ` e ' the spirit is distilled and made with cereals , yeast and water . comes from the gaelic ` uisge beatha ' , or ` usquebaugh ' , meaning ` water of life ' since 2007 , legally , scotch single malt whisky must be produced in scotland . term single malt scotch whisky can only be used for a scotch whisky distilled at a single distillery . from 2012 , by law , bottles labelled single malt scotch wisky can only be produced in scotland . whisky . does not mature , no matter how long it is kept for . for example , a . 10-year-old whisky does not become a 50-year-old whisky if kept for 50 . years . different grains can be used for the spirit : barley , rye , corn , maize . the process : first the whisky is malted , which means sugar is extracted from barley and turned into alcohol using yeast . next , the malt is ground and hot water is added . the product is distilled - which means that the liquid is heated to the correct temperature . with whisky the process usually happens twice . liquid is then stored and matured in oak casks . the whisky is then blended and bottled . hundreds of miles away in fife , another unlikely entrepreneur has had a bright idea : to create the first bottle of scottish wine . in september , in upper largo , some 40 miles from edinburgh , weather dependant , scotland 's first grapes will be harvested . meanwhile in fife : christopher trotter will soon be selling bottles of chateau largo from grapes grown some 30 miles from edinburgh . by summer 2015 , christopher trotter , the man behind the scottish wine , will be enjoying a bottle of chateau largo - created off the a197 . chateau largo will be a medium dry white wine - with a similar taste to chardonnay or riesling . the project of bringing wine to scotland began with a throwaway comment when a friend of mr trotter 's said that if climate change continued , fife would be the same temperature as the loire valley within 20 years . thanks to another friend who supported the project financially , mr trotter was able to bring 100 vines from ryedale in north yorkshire to scotland . he is growing three grape varieties : solaris , siegerrebe and rondo - all of which originate from germany . the grapes were chosen because they can all be harvested in september before temperatures drop . the plot is a six acre site , with a south-facing slope overlooking the north sea , where , mr trotter says the sunshine is ` fantastic ' . last july the average temperature in fife was 21.4 degrees . this morning however , the temperature is just 7 degrees and the humidity is 76 per cent . but according to mr trotter the plot 's location is key to the wine 's success - there are no hills blocking the sun and drainage to get rid of the rain . mr trotter has high hopes for the british wine industry . if the wine is a success , he hopes to attract an investor who will help finance planting 5,000 vineyards and produce 15,000 bottles of wine a year .	 daniel szor will distil cotswolds single malt in stourton , warwickshire .   has imported a master distiller from scotland and a wood consultant to help .   was looking at the barley in his garden and thought ' i could distill that '   spring water from oxfordshire will be used to add a local touch .   hopes to produce 120,000 bottles a year with # 44.95 pricetag .   ` to us scotland is not intimidating , it is a road to follow , ' he says .

331	we 're told to eat less if we want to reduce our waistlines . and when it comes to mars and snickers treats we 'll be doing just that from now on whether we like it or not ... but the manufacturer claims it 's all for our own good . mars uk is shrinking the size of its two most popular bars again and it says it is doing so to help quell the obesity crisis . however , the move will actually make our purses lighter as the price is staying the same . shrinking bars : both mars and snickers bars have been reduced in size by more than 10 per cent but the recommended selling price has remained the same . the company said the decision to reduce . mars from 58g to 51g and snickers from 58g to 48g is part of a pledge to . cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250 . a spokesman . added : ` to meet our commitment , having taken product reformulation as . far as we can for now without compromising the great taste , we have . reduced the portion size of mars and snickers to bring down the . calories . ' mars will now have 229 calories and snickers will have 245 . in 2008 , the company also reduced the bars ' size , from 62.5 g to 58g . the chocolate giant committed early in 2012 to cut the calorie content of its single-serve products to a maximum of 250 calories by the end of 2013 as part of its calorie reduction responsibility deal pledge . as a result of the size changes , the number of calories in a mars bar has dropped from 260 to 229 and in a snickers bar from 280 to 245 . mars said it had little choice but to reduce the size of the products because there was a limit to what could now be achieved through reformulation . in 2010 , it cut the saturated fat content of a mars bar by 15 per cent and removed all transfats . a mars spokesman told the grocer : ` as part of our global commitment to promote responsible consumption , and as a signatory of the responsibility deal 's calorie reduction pledge , we said we would ensure that all our single-serve chocolate products would contain no more than 250 calories per portion . ` to meet our commitment , having taken product reformulation as far as we can for now without compromising the great taste , we have reduced the portion size of mars and snickers to bring down the calorie content . ' the grocer magazine says that it is not the first time that mars has reduced the size of mars and snickers . in 2008 , it cut the size of both products from 62.5 g to 58g while leaving the price the same . mars has reduced the size of the bars in the wake of big hikes in the cost of chocolate-making over the past decade and cost inflation was particularly severe this year . mars bars have been reduced from 58g to 51g to ensure they contain less than 250 calories . in analysis for the grocer in october , commodity pricing specialists mintec said that cost of producing an average milk chocolate bar had soared by 25 per cent year-on-year , adding 6p to the cost of making a 100g bar of plain milk chocolate . the main culprit for soaring costs was the rocketing price of cocoa butter which has been hit by adverse weather in the ivory coast - one of the most important growing countries . in march this year , researchers from consumer watchdog which ? discovered that big name food producers have reduced pack sizes by as much as a quarter without reducing the price . they found that ` underhand ' and ` hidden price hikes ' were on many items including frozen foods , bags of sweets and crisps and dishwasher tablets . which ? said many everyday products now offer poorer value for money because of the ` hidden price hikes ' . which ? executive director richard lloyd said : ` shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices do n't . ` we want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest , and for special offers to be genuine . ' when the magazine asked the makers of these products why they had shrunk them , they were generally told that , in the face of rising costs they chose to shrink products rather than increase prices . but a survey of 1,257 which ? members found that well over half - 58 per cent - said they would rather prices rose than packs got smaller . a further 37 per cent would rather the pack shrank , but only if they were told . earlier this year , former public health minister anna soubry described mars ' calorie reduction pledge as ' absolutely brilliant . ' she told the grocer : ` they do n't have to do it but are doing it for all the right reasons . '	 chocolate giant mars has shrunk the size of its bars from 58g to 51g .   its snickers bars have also been reduced from 58g to 48g .   but the recommended selling price of 51p has remained the same .   the company said the size reduction was essential to meet its pledge that all single-serve products will be a maximum of 250 calories .

333	gps handing out antibiotics to placate demanding patients is leading to a rise in resistant superbugs that could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' family doctors are needlessly doling out antibiotics to ` placate ' patients , an influential group of mps warns today . the practice of gps using the drugs ` simply to achieve a placebo effect ' is fuelling a growth in antibiotic resistance , according to a report by the commons science and technology committee . the mail reported last week how the country 's chief medical officer , dame sally davies , said that patients pressing gps for antibiotics were part of the problem . she also said she will die from a routine infection if she undergoes a hip replacement operation 20 years from now . another expert said gps were issuing the drugs to up to 90 per cent of the patients they see with distressing symptoms -- whether or not they would be any use . the problem is so serious that david cameron last week said superbugs ' resistance to antibiotics could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' . now he is being urged by the committee to back his words with ` decisive and urgent action ' before it is too late to stem a tide of infections that can not be treated . the mps ' report says : ` for too long , antibiotics have been used as if they were a bottomless pit of cure-all miracle treatments . ` antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and other diseases that are not caused by bacteria and the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics has contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance . ' the committee warned in particular of gps using antibiotics as a placebo to make patients think they are getting effective treatments , even when the drugs have no medical impact . andrew miller , chairman of the committee which has completed a seven-month inquiry , said : ` antibiotic resistance can not be entirely prevented , but it is a problem made worse by inappropriate use and poor stewardship of antibiotics in healthcare and farming . about 35 ¿ million prescriptions for antibiotics are are given out a year by gps in england . the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 as 5,000 people a year die from resistant bacteria . ` we heard concerns , for instance , that antibiotics are often prescribed by gps simply to achieve a placebo effect or placate patients with distressing symptoms . ` in farming , meanwhile , we suspect that antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals . ' dr michael moore of the royal college of general practitioners told the committee that gps were issuing antibiotics to up to nine out of ten patients , the report says . antibiotics , designed to fight bacteria , are routinely given to treat viral infections such as colds and flu . while patients may leave the surgery happy , the prescription will do little to fight their illness . about 35 million prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed every year by gps in england . the number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 , according to nhs figures . meanwhile 5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections in england every year . the nhs has brought down rates of two of the most serious superbugs -- mrsa and c.difficile -- through a huge awareness campaign and improved hygiene in hospitals . but new threats have emerged to replace them , including e.coli , cases of which increased 30 per cent between 2005 and 2009 . increased cleanlines in hospitals has brought rates of mrsa -lrb- pictured -rrb- and c.difficile infection down but new strains have emerged to replace them , such as e.coli . the committee report says : ` we found . it difficult to understand how the government has failed to act . decisively to address the issue of inappropriate prescription of . antibiotics . ' dame sally . has asked the government to put antibiotic resistance on the national . risk register , ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack . she has warned that without action we may return to a ` 19th-century environment ' in which routine operations are potentially deadly . she told the committee : ` when i need a new hip in 20 years , i will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics . ' mr cameron announced last week that jim o'neill , former chief economist at goldman sachs , will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur drug development . but mr miller said : ` publishing strategies and announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem . ` what we really need from government right now is decisive and urgent action to prevent antibiotics from being given to people and animals who do not need them . ' the committee says greater public awareness is needed to ease pressure on gps to dish out the drugs .	 mps warn doctors are handing out too many prescriptions for antibiotics .   family doctors giving out medicine unnecessarily to placate patients .   over-use is leading to rise in superbug strains resistant to antibiotics .   david cameron warned bugs could send medicine ` back to the dark ages ' 
334	peekaboo : researchers found that young children believe they are invisible if people ca n't see their eyes . it 's an adorable game parents have played with their young children for generations . but now researchers are looking for a scientific answer to explain why children think they actually disappear when they cover their eyes while playing peekaboo . researchers led by james russell at the university of cambridge have carried out the first study into this bizarre trait with groups of three and four-year-old children . the children 's eyes were covered with masks and they were then asked whether they could be seen by the researchers - with most saying no . many also believed that the researchers could not see adults who were wearing eye masks - leading to the conclusion most young children believe that anyone who covers their eyes is obscured from other people 's view . the researchers then attempted to distinguish what exactly creates the feeling of invisibility - whether it was not being able to see at all or just because the other person could n't see their eyes . the children were given a pair of mirrored goggles so that while they could see through the glasses , no one could see their eyes . unfortunately , only 7 of the 37 participating children were able to get to grips with the idea that while they could still see , no one could see their eyes . but of those who did understand the concept , six believed they were invisible if the researchers could n't see their eyes , even if they could still see them . although when the children were asked to . explain how they were made invisible by simply hiding their eyes , many . knew that their bodies remained visible , suggesting a childhood . distinction between their physical bodies and the ` self ' they connect to . their eyes . hide and seek : the children in the survey also believed that other people become invisible if they cover their eyes even though their bodies are still visible . to test this theory that children believe they can be seen only through their eyes , the researchers looked directly at each of the children while asking them to avert their gaze . they then did the same process in reverse , with the children looking at the researchers while they diverted their eyes . in each instance , the majority of children felt they were not being seen so long as their eyes did n't meet the other person 's , giving some support to the ideology of eyes being the the window to the soul .	 university of cambridge researchers found that children believe they become invisible if other people ca n't see their eyes .   toddlers also thought adults ca n't be seen if their eyes are hidden - even if their bodies are visible .   study shows link between the ` sense of self ' and the eyes . 
335	israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been left red-faced after a video shot by a celebrity home designer depicting his modest lifestyle was revealed to be recorded in his servants ' quarters . the 15-minute film by moshik galamin showed mr netanyahu 's wife sara guiding the viewer around the couple 's home , where run down parts of the property such as creaking doors and frayed carpets , are detailed . but it has now emerged galamin was not granted access to the couple 's upstairs living quarters , and israel 's channel 10 tv claimed the kitchen in question was not even the one the netanyahus use , but rather a secondary administrative kitchen . netanyahu 's wife sara bemoans the state of their kitchen in a home remodelling show . however , it has emerged the kitchen is used by administrative staff , not the the netanyahus themselves . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu -lrb- pictured -rrb- has become embroiled in an expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money on food , furniture and gardening . the embarrassing video forms just one of a series of damaging developments in netanyahu 's expenses controversy after an official watchdog criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money . in the clip , sara netanyahu unveils to interior designer galamin a simple home with creaking doors and windows , frayed carpets , dusty lamps , cracked light fixtures and paint peeling off neglected walls . she bemoans how they did n't have the budget to fix upholstery before the 2013 visit of president barack obama and says he was forced to sit on a coffee-stained couch . ' i do n't notice the details because i do n't dare think about it , ' she says as she points to mildew in a courtyard . ` when you walk out , make sure the door handle does n't break off , ' she said with a giggle as he parted . galamin , who hosts a popular home remodeling tv show , said he funded the shoot - which opposition lawmakers say violated israeli campaign finance laws . a former chief of the shin bet security service called the film a ` severe security breach ' and said terrorist groups would have been willing to pay a hefty sum to acquire such an inside look at the prime minister 's home . netanyahu 's office had no immediate comment on the tv report . sara netanyahu - a former member of the couple 's housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by her . the video , perhaps ironically , is set to catchy background music that includes the theme song from the netflix series ` house of cards ' and justin timberlake 's hit ` cry me a river .

' netanyahu 's rivals pounced on the material . the centrist yesh atid party , which has made corruption a centerpiece of its campaign , said the report and video reflected how disconnected netanyahu was from real problems of average israelis , who just three years ago took to the streets en masse to protest the country 's high cost of living . ` what matters are the citizens , not the carpets , ' it said . meanwhile , the government 's state comptroller has found ` excessive ' amounts of public funds have been spent by mr netanyahu and his wife sara , on food , furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home . in a report by the official watchdog , it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of caesarea averaged more than # 1,370 a month in taxpayer 's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there . it was also said they pocketed proceeds from recycling bottles that had been purchased for entertaining official guests . it said the bottle returns , and purchases of garden furniture for their private home , may have violated the law . the watchdog 's findings have ramped up tensions between the premier and his opponents in the run - up to elections on march 17 which have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters . mr netanyahu promised to follow the recommendations to curb spending but he also criticised the ` ongoing media campaign ' surrounding the report , which he said was aimed at toppling him . netanyahu 's opponents have tried to portray him as enjoying a lavish lifestyle and being out of touch with the struggles of average israelis . netanyahu 's allies angrily dismissed the allegations as part of a campaign to deflect attention from important national security issues . mr netanyahu and his wife are no strangers to such scrutiny . the prime minister has long been saddled with an image as a cigar-smoking , cognac-drinking socialite , while his wife has come under fire for her own expensive tastes and alleged abusive behavior toward staff . the netanyahus accuse the israeli media of a longstanding witch hunt against them . in a statement , netanyahu said he respected the findings of the comptroller and pledged to implement recommendations to curb wasteful spending . two days before the state comptroller released its report , netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on facebook that appeared aimed at countering his hedonistic image ahead of march 17 elections . at the same time he lashed out at the ` ongoing media campaign ' that he said is aimed at toppling him . ` there is absolutely no indication of any assault on the public 's integrity and certainly no indication of any criminal transgressions , ' he said . a former member of their housekeeping staff has filed a lawsuit claiming he was mistreated and verbally abused by sara netanyahu . in one instance , meni naftali alleged she called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton . in another , he claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old . netanyahu said expenses have dropped significantly in the two years since the departure of naftali , a man he described as ` an embittered former public employee . ' over the years , reports have been released about the high cost of the netanyahus ' catering , housekeeping , furniture , clothing and makeup . in one case , the premier was chided for spending $ 127,000 in public funds for a special sleeping cabin on a flight to london . even their costly purchases of scented candles and pistachio-flavored ice cream have been derided . two days before the state comptroller released its report , netanyahu posted a 15-minute video on facebook that appeared aimed at countering the hedonistic image ahead of march 17 elections that have focused on the economic woes of middle and lower-class voters .	 benjamin netanyahu has become embroiled in an expenses controversy .   an official watchdog has criticised his spending of taxpayers ' money .   found ` excessive ' amounts of public funds has been spent by pm and wife .   but video at his home revealed to have been filmed in servants ' quarters .   in it , his wife sara bemoans the state of their kitchen and frayed carpets .   she said there was no budget to fix upholstery before obama 's 2013 visit .

343	barack obama is facing poll numbers that are now in the same territory as president george w. bush 's following hurricane katrina . the quinnipiac university polling institute released numbers on tuesday showing that just 38 per cent of registered voters approve of the job obama is doing as president , with a whopping 56 per cent saying they disapprove . the president has lost his landslide electoral edge among young voters , too , with a negative 41 -- 49 per cent rating among 18 - to 29-year-old voters . his once formidable support among hispanics has also evaporated : they now support him by an historically small 50 -- 43 per cent margin . worse for obama 's fast-approaching legacy-building years , the public believes he is not ` honest and . trustworthy , ' by a 52 -- 44 per cent score . a smaller majority , 51 per cent , said he lacks ` strong leadership qualities . ' respondents said by a 41 -- 38 per cent gap that they would vote for a republican over a democrat for the u.s. house of representatives , the first time this year democrats have had a winning posture in the quinnipiac poll . friendlier shores : barack obama got a rousing ovation from a crowd attending the official memorial service for late south african president nelson mandela on tuesday , a change of pace from americans who are losing faith in his policies . majority leader ? mitch mcconnell , the leader of the u.s. senate 's gop minority , would run congress ' upper chamber in 2015 if the public 's feelings about who should run the capitol hold up . and 47 per cent of voters said they would like to see republicans gain control of both houses of congress . the gop can achieve that outcome if it holds the house and picks up seven senate seats in november 2014 . fully half of independent voters -- those aligned with neither the democratic nor the republican party -- said they would back a congress completely under republican control . ` president obama could be pretty lonely during his last two years in office if voters decide they want republican majorities in the house and senate , ' said quinnipiac university polling institute assistant director tim malloy . but congress has n't had an easy ride either : 74 per cent of voters disapprove of the way congressional republicans are doing their jobs . a smaller 67 per cent group says democrats in congress are also falling shirt of the mark . exhibit a : health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius is presiding over a health insurance overhaul that has drawn catcalls and sighs from the public as its website flails and its sticker shocks hit home . pollsters interviewed nearly 2,700 voters between dec. 3 and dec. 9 , asking their opinions after a spate of positive news hit tv broadcasts and internet news portals about jobs and the economy . the results suggest the staying power of obama 's unpopular health insurance overhaul and his administration 's controversial nuclear deal with iran . even democrats are beginning to doubt the president who famously promised hope and change : 18 per cent of them now say they 're no fans of obama 's work in the oval office . malloy called the news ' a rousing chorus of bah ! humbug ! for president barack obama as american voters head into the holidays with little charitable to say . ' that includes his handling of specific issues . while obama enjoys a 50 -- 41 per cent positive rating for his handling of terrorism , that 's the only issue quinnipiac polled where he comes out on top . he 's under water on the economy , 37 -- 59 per cent , 34 -- 62 percent on health care and 42 -- 49 per cent on foreign policy . iran , too , is making americans uncomfortable . just 40 per cent of registered voters say they approve of the white house 's approach to the islamic republic , whose expanding nuclear program is the subject of a deal brokered in november by the u.s. and five other nations . a larger 48 per cent group disapprove . americans are less disapproving of the agreement itself , by a 44 -- 46 margin , and a 45 -- 37 plurality say it will make america ` less safe . ' making nice with the mullahs ? secretary of state john kerry got a grilling in a house foreign affairs committee hearing on tuesday , defending the obama administration 's decision to pursue a nuclear pact with iran . the only good news for the white house is that americans support obama 's pitch to raise the minimum wage nation-wide . fully 69 per cent support hiking it by at least some amount , with 27 per cent opposed . but the pollsters offered their interviewees three separate choices of how much to raise the minimum wage , compared with only one option to leave it alone . gop lawmakers cite economic studies that show minimum wage hikes have corresponded with job losses , particularly among low-skilled and minority workers , as companies let people go in order to comply with wage hikes without spending more money on human resources .	 obama 's support among young voters has disappeared , with 49 per cent now saying they disapprove of his job performance .   hispanics ' historic preference for the president shows signs of evaporating , with 43 per cent opposing him .   52 per cent of the voting public now says obama is not ` honest and trustworthy ' and 51 per cent say he lacks ` strong leadership qualities '   americans who want republicans to control both houses of congress now outnumber those who fear one-party control .

348	nancy snyderman 's actions caused a local maid to get fired due to ebola fears in the town . nbc chief medical correspondent nancy snyderman caused a local maid to be fired when she violated a voluntary ebola quarantine agreement . the maid , known only as vilma , was turned away by two of her employers after dr snyderman visited her favorite new jersey soup restaurant last week . vilma 's brother is the chef at the peasant grill , near princeton , and people in the town were concerned that the woman could have been exposed to the deadly virus . they panicked because one of the members of the quarantined nbc crew went into the restaurant and they feared the chef may have then exposed his sister to the disease , tmz reported . two homeowners who had been using vilma for years told her she could not work with them until further notice . dr syderman , 62 , was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days after the station 's cameraman ashoka mukpo tested positive for ebola while working in liberia . but witnesses said that the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up in her mercedes outside the soup restaurant . shortly after the alleged trip to the dining spot , the new jersey department of health forced dr snyderman and her crew into mandatory quarantine . local health officials say they investigated and there is no risk that anyone who was in the restaurant could have contracted ebola during the incident . however , it seems that not everyone believes this . according to the national review online , neighbors say that the previously well-reviewed peasant grill restaurant now appears to be quite empty . scroll down for video . the maid 's brother was a chef at the peasant grill restaurant - where dr snyderman visited last week in breach of her voluntary ebola quarantine agreement . it has also suffered a few questionable reviews . ` please understand that people who have recently returned from africa and were quarantined for ebola , broke thier -lsb- sic -rsb- quarantine order and went to this establishment to pick up food , ' one person wrote on google reviews . ` this is very serious , there is no hard facts about how ebola is transmitted , it is such a serious , virulent virus . be careful , do n't go to this restaurant anytime soon . they should , out of an abundance of caution , close thier -lsb- sic -rsb- doors for a reasonable period of time and sue dr nancy snyderman .

' i know everyone is raving about their ebolas of soup -- and i love them as much as the next guy , but not sure if i would die for them , ' one person wrote . dr snyderman has not yet accepted personal responsibility for the violation , instead shifting the blame onto the whole team . in an apologetic statement read out on nbc on monday , she said : ` while under voluntary quarantine guidelines , which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days , members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed . ` we remain healthy and our temperatures are normal . ` as a health professional i know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public , but i am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused .

354	videoed : former minister tim yeo was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private . a tory mp has complained about a government global-warming adviser 's undisclosed green interests -- despite the fact he himself is paid a fortune by eco-energy and transport firms . tim yeo , chairman of the energy and climate change select committee , has protested about lord deben remaining chairman of veolia water uk while also chairing the committee on climate change , an independent body that advises the government on the impact of climate change . mr yeo 's critics will argue his protest smacks of hypocrisy as he has been paid more than # 400,000 by three green companies since 2009 . lord deben , john selwyn gummer -- who as agriculture minister in 1990 tried to persuade his daughter cordelia to eat a hamburger during the bse crisis -- was required to undergo a ` confirmation hearing ' before yeo 's committee last september after being appointed chair of the climate change committee . at the time lord deben had stepped down from his job as chairman of forewinds , a consortium set up to build a hugely subsidised windfarm , but he remained chairman of veolia water uk . asked at the hearing whether this could be a conflict of interest , lord deben said he had resigned from all his energy business interests , adding : ` if you look at what it -lsb- veolia -rsb- does , it really has no connection at all . and if i thought it even had a remote connection , i would make that change -lsb- resign -rsb- . ' but , as this newspaper revealed in january , veolia has a thriving eco business connecting windfarms to the national grid . mr yeo has set out his protest in a letter to energy secretary mr davey . he wrote : ` the committee was given to understand that veolia was not an energy company , and that lord deben would not retain links with energy companies . . . but , as is clear from veolia 's website and annual report and accounts , the company has a significant role in the field of energy . ' mr yeo added : ` the lack of clarity on this specific point has caused ongoing media criticism . . . the reassurances you have given are not sufficient to effectively address the perception of conflict of interest in the public domain . ' mr yeo has been paid # 402,033.88 by . three green companies since august 2009 . he is paid many thousands more . as a director of the channel tunnel company . the . ` chunnel ' contains a cable whose purpose is to keep britain 's lights on . using french power if our own supply becomes inadequate following the . shutdown of coal stations caused by green restrictions . lord . deben yesterday continued to insist he had ` no dealings whatsoever ' with the veolia division that dealt with energy . he added : ` since being . made aware of this activity , i have ensured that i will never be . involved , receive any papers , or participate in any way . ' fresh storm : as agriculture minister in 1990 lord deben , john selwyn gummer , tried to persuade his daughter cordelia to eat a hamburger during the bse crisis . energy and climate change secretary ed davey used a speech at the met office last week to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers such as this one , claiming we have published misleading ` destructive scepticism ' and ignoring the science on global warming . here our correspondent writes an open letter in reply : it is mr davey david rose says , who is being less than straight with the facts . dear ed . last week you made a speech which sounded uncomfortably as if you wanted to shut this newspaper up . you said that journalists like me , who have raised serious questions about global warming and energy policy , were ` selectively misreading the evidence ' and arguing that ` we can relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want ' . you claimed that instead of publishing ` the serious science ' , we were propagating ` destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism , born of vested interest . ' worse still , in your eyes , we have suggested that your policies as energy and climate change secretary are ` hopelessly misguided ' because we oppose the vast increases in ` renewable ' energy subsidies which you set out in your energy bill . outburst : energy and climate change secretary ed davey used a speech at the met office to mount an extraordinary and intemperate attack on newspapers . the mail on sunday was the only publication which you mentioned by name . so i hope you wo n't mind when i point out that much of your speech was highly misleading . it was a grade-a example of how those in power have become entrenched and wilfully blind to new evidence -- of how you seek to crush debate by attacking opponents by mischaracterising what we actually say . according to you , we ` reject outright that climate change is a result of human activity ' . you commented contemptuously : ` it 's the science , stupid ! ' after all , a recent survey found that 97 per cent of a sample of 12,000 climate science papers accept that human activity -- increased carbon dioxide emissions -- has contributed to global warming . how could we be so dumb as to ignore a consensus like that ? you , you said , are ` with the 97 per cent ' . well , mr davey , so am i , as are almost all the climate sceptics and so-called ` deniers ' i have ever spoken to . the point is : yes , human activity has warmed the planet , and will probably continue to do so . the far more difficult questions are how far and how fast is this likely to happen ? and here the scientific consensus is heading in one direction -- towards the view that the world is warming rather more slowly than was thought only a few years ago . as this newspaper first reported in october , world temperatures have failed to show any statistically significant increase since 1997 . according to you , this is a ` false summit ' , after which warming will again become rampant . but surely you must also know that this . unexpected ` pause ' was not predicted by most climate computer models . professor judith curry of the georgia technical institute testified at a . us congressional hearing that it is likely to last for at least another . ten years . if it does , climate alarmism -- all your talk of a ` massive . gamble with the planet our children will inherit ' -- is going to look , . well , stupid . load of hot air : professor myles allen , head of oxford university ¿ s climate research network , has said that billions are being wasted on measures including windfarms in scotland . your mention of the mail on sunday came when you quoted an article two weeks ago by professor myles allen , head of oxford university 's climate research network . yes , prof allen did say that ` almost everyone agrees ' that emissions have to come down . but he went on to add that we are wasting billions on policies -- that 's your policies , mr davey -- which will never achieve this end . he says : ` 90 per cent of the measures adopted since the 1997 kyoto agreement to cut global emissions are a waste of time and money -- including windfarms in scotland , carbon taxes and byzantine carbon trading systems . ' in your speech , you implied that if we set ever more ambitious targets covering our own pitiful two per cent of world emissions , one day those much bigger economies will follow suit . oh really ? right now , china and india have about 800 coal power stations being built or on order . we need a proper debate about these issues , one which is n't fuelled by alarmism and which appreciates that your opponents have valid viewpoints , too . but all you have to offer is more of the same : bigger doses of policy prescriptions -- taxes , subsidies and the futile quest for a binding global agreement -- which have demonstrably failed . there is a cost for this . britain already has the highest inflation in energy prices in europe -lrb- which actually means the world -rrb- . yet everything you are doing will increase this further . perhaps you think that if you maintain the scaremongering at a shrill enough volume , you 'll get away with it . maybe in the short term you will . history , and the ballot box in 2015 , may not be as kind . yours sincerely . david .	 tim yeo has complained about lord deben 's undisclosed green interests .   mr yeo has been paid more than # 400,000 by three green companies .   lord deben is chairman of firm which connects windfarms to national grid .

356	britain has wasted # 250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity to a community of 55 people in the south pacific . the # 1.7 million scheme was scrapped after australian contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines on the islands made famous by the mutiny on the bounty . a report from the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- admitted officials had failed to ` rigorously manage ' the pitcairn islands ' eco project . wasted energy : britain has wasted # 250,000 of its aid budget trying to bring green electricity the pitcairn islands . population : there are only around 55 people on the islands , making the original scheme cost the equivalent of # 31,000 per head . by the time the scheme was abandoned it had slipped three years behind schedule and doubled in initial costs . the uk first took responsibility for the remote volcanic islands after they were inhabited by mutinous sailors from the crew of the bounty in 1789 . led by fletcher christian , they settled there to escape the hangman 's noose after staging a rebellion against captain william bligh . all of the rocky outcrop 's inhabitants can trace their roots back to members of the crew of the bounty . two years ago the mail revealed that the . overseas territory received # 2.4 million a year from british taxpayers -- . more than # 43,000 per person every year . mutiny : english sailor fletcher christian led the mutiny against captain william bligh on hms bounty in 1789 . now , documents reveal # 250,000 of the uk 's aid budget has been wasted trying to bring wind power to the descendants of the ship 's mutinous crew . during the fiasco the uk taxpayer ended up having to foot the bill for chartering a ship to take equipment to the islands . but the charter had to be cancelled because the shipment was not ready to transport . eventually officials from dfid decided to abandon the scheme . experts are now trying to convince them that a solar-powered generator would be a better option . critics have questioned why the islands need such an expensive green electricity system in the first place . there are only around 55 people living there -- so the original scheme cost the equivalent of # 31,000 per head . now , if dfid gives the green light to the new solar-powered generator , the total cost of the island 's electricity supply will be even higher than the estimated bill for the original project . aid bosses say the government has a duty to spend cash on the island , as it is still a british overseas territory . overseas territories take priority from the aid budget under laws set down in the un charter . but the government has been roundly criticised for ring-fencing the uk 's aid spending in a time of austerity . foreign aid is one of the few departments not to have faced a cut in funding . a report into the defunct scheme explains : ` the contractors engaged in 2007 completed the first stages of the project . ` however , due to continual late . submission dates of key deliverables and escalating costs , which more . than doubled , the time frame stretched by three years . ' scrapped : the # 1.7 million scheme was axed after australian contractors pocketed huge amounts of cash without building any wind turbines , such as these in west yorkshire -lrb- file picture -rrb- . a dfid spokesman said : ` where contracts are not good value for money and are not being properly delivered , we will take action to protect taxpayer money . ` the uk government will be working with the pitcairn island government in order to assess the current and future energy needs , including green options such as solar power . ' but robert oxley , from the taxpayers ' alliance , said : ` it 's frankly typical of dfid to waste so much taxpayers ' money on a project that delivers so little . ` one of the consequences of spending up to an arbitrary aid target is that there is little incentive for officials to deliver value for taxpayers ' money . no one has been held to account for the repeated blunders over this project .

361	beaming : ruth wright , 48 , was able to avoid a hysterectomy thanks to mr-guided focused ultrasound surgery . a revolutionary no-knife procedure is being used to treat fibroids -- and it could save thousands of women from a hysterectomy . it uses a high-energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic -- resulting in a far shorter recovery time . the beam is guided through continuous magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- that allows the surgical team to see inside the body . ` this is a revolutionary procedure , ' says consultant interventional radiologist dr paul crowe , who offers the treatment at spire parkway hospital in birmingham . he has treated 15 cases so far in collaboration with consultant gynaecologist shirin irani . ` as well as needing no general anaesthetic , it is non-invasive . recovery is faster and there are few risks of complication or side effects . ' fibroids are common tumours on the wall of the uterus and are usually benign . ` about 25 per cent of women of child-bearing age have them , and up to 40 per cent in later life , ' says dr crowe . ` although some women have no idea they even have them , a substantial number need treatment . ' treatment is recommended if the fibroids cause symptoms , which can include heavy bleeding , pressure on the bladder or bowel -- meaning increased urination , bloating or constipation -- or fertility problems . ` there is an association with early miscarriage , or in later pregnancy there may be a problem with space , ' says dr crowe . ` it 's not known why they cause heavy bleeding but they grow in response to oestrogen . ' most treatments involve surgery , with many women having a hysterectomy -- removal of the uterus . half the 50,000 hysterectomies done on the nhs every year are fibroid-related . this operation can take two hours under general anaesthetic , requires a hospital stay and patients can take eight weeks to recover . company director ruth wright , 48 , was advised to have a hysterectomy when she developed fibroids . she had been suffering heavy bleeding . ` some days i could n't leave the bathroom , ' she says . ` it was a nightmare . i was dragging myself to work every day , through the school run and supper , and could n't ride my beloved horses for more than ten minutes without being exhausted . ' after several months , her doctor found she was anaemic and prescribed depo-provera , a progesterone contraceptive injection that often stops periods altogether . when that did n't work , ruth had a scan . ` the radiologist said i had fibroids so large it was as if i was carrying an 18-week foetus , ' she recalls . how it is done : msgfus uses a high-energy , focused ultrasound beam to heat and destroy the fibroid without the need for invasive surgery and anaesthetic . the gynaecologist recommended a hysterectomy . ` i was convinced there must be another solution . i could n't bear more time away from work and my family . i went home and sat at my laptop -- when i found the new procedure it seemed ideal . ' the mr-guided focused ultrasound surgery -lrb- mrgfus -rrb- can be done in a few hours under light sedation . symptoms start to diminish immediately . the nhs was happy to consider funding mrgfus for ruth , but she could n't face waiting so had it privately . after light sedation , the patient lies very still on the stomach in an mri scanner with the fibroid directly over the ultrasound . the surgical team plot and guide the treatment from a control room using the mri console . ` it was n't the most fun four hours , ' says ruth . ` but i was n't in any pain . you have to stay completely still but the main problem is feeling chilly and a bit bored . every now and again the ultrasound beam bounces off the pelvis and you feel discomfort . but i had a button to press if this happened , and the second i did so they moved the beam . i went home and had an excellent night 's sleep with just a couple of painkillers . ' two days later the bleeding had eased significantly , and continued to tail off over the following weeks . consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist clive spence-jones says : ` the science is excellent , with good clinical trials , and could be fantastic in certain situations . though fibroids have to be on the front of the uterus with no bowel in between and ca n't be too large . the procedure is likely to become popular . ' dr crowe adds : ` occasionally there may be some redness , minor pain , skin burns or bruising . these usually resolve within ten days . ' the treated fibroids will not grow back but there is a small risk of new ones growing . ` i went in on the thursday and was back at work on monday , ' says ruth . ` my life has been changed . ' spirehealthcare.com/parkway .	 new no-knife procedure could save thousands from hysterectomy .   ruth wright , 48 , was rid of fibroids after new mri treatment .   mr-guided focused ultrasound surgery takes only a few hours .

365	a pakistani former dancing girl left fighting for life by a ` horrific ' acid attack has committed suicide a decade after being heavily facially disfigured . fakhra younus , 33 , leapt to her death from a sixth floor building in rome 12 years after the acid attack which she said left her looking ` not human ' . at the time of her attack in may 2000 , her ex-husband bilal khar was the man accused of entering her mother 's house and pouring acid over younus 's face as she slept . life-changing : fakhra younus , pictured left before the horrific acid attack in may 2000 , was left heavily facially disfigured after having acid thrown in her face . the attack , which took place in front of younus 's then five-year-old son , left her unable to breathe and fighting for life . her nose was almost completely melted and she has since undergone 39 separate surgical procedures to repair her disfigured face over the past decade . the horrific attack also burned off her hair , fused her lips , blinded her in one eye , destroyed her left ear and melted her breasts . after being rushed to hospital she said , ` my face is a prison to me ' , while her distraught young son said at the time , ` this is not my mother ' . disfigured : younus , left , pictured with supporter tehmina durrani , has undergone 39 separate surgical operations to repair the damage done to her face . the mother-of-one moved to italy after the incident to live in rome and continue her treatment . but on march 17 she took her own life , after leaving a message saying she was committing suicide over the silence of law on the atrocities and the insensitivity of pakistani rulers . cleared : younus 's ex-husband bilal khar , the son of a wealthy pakistani governor , was cleared in 2003 of charges relating to the attack . bilal khar was arrested in 2002 and charged with attempted murder following the attack , only to be released on bail after five months . khar , an ex-parliamentarian and son of a wealthy pakistani governor , was eventually cleared of the attack , though many believe he could have used his family connections to escape conviction . after younus 's tragic suicide emerged earlier this month , khar continued to deny having any part in the attack - claiming in a television interview a different man with the same name had carried out the crime . khar claimed his ex-wife killed herself because she did n't have enough money , not because of her horrific injuries . more than 8,500 acid attacks , forced marriages and other forms of violence against women were reported in pakistan in 2011 , according to the aurat foundation , a women 's rights organization . the pakistani government introduced new laws last year criminalising acid attacks and stating that convicted attacks would serve at least 14 years in jail . tehmina durrani , the ex-wife of bilal khar 's father , had become an advocate for younus after the attack , and said the acid attack victim had pledged to bring her attacker to justice when she had recovered . mourning : fakhra younus 's body is carried through karachi airport in her native pakistan after her body was returned to the country from italy . grief : family members of fakhra younus can not hide their anguish at karachi airport as the acid attack victim 's body was returned to pakistan . durrani said : ` she said , ` when i come back , i will reopen the case , and i 'll fight myself , '' and she was a fighter . ' durrani said younus ' case should be a reminder that the pakistani government needs to do much more to prevent acid attacks and other forms of violence against women , and also help the victims . ' i think this whole country should be extremely embarrassed that a foreign country took responsibility for a pakistani citizen for 13 years because we could give her nothing , not justice , not security , ' said durrani .	 fakhra younus said ` my face is a prison ' after attack which melted her nose .   she had undergone 39 separate surgeries to repair damage .   leapt to her death from sixth floor rome building earlier this month .   her ex-husband was charged with attempted murder in 2002 but has since been acquitted .

369	the word schmeat -- a form of meat produced synthetically from biological tissue -- made it on to the shortlist for the oxford dictionaries ' word of the year . the word is rarely used , but its very inclusion in the shortlist reflects the long-term significance of the events that occurred in london in august , when the world 's first lab-grown hamburger -- developed by a team at maastricht university in the netherlands -- was cooked and served . it 's a vital development , because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult . the united nations ' food and agriculture organisation estimates that demand for meat will increase by more than two-thirds over the next 40 years . burgers could soon be both healthy and sustainable produced , according to dr emma davies , a food scientist . the dutch scientists responsible for the first schmeat predict ` cultured ' meats -lrb- ones grown artificially -rrb- could be commercially available within 10 to 20 years . ` with the current technology , we can make the meat at a reasonable price and that will only come down as we improve the production process , ' says lead scientist professor mark post . ` there are still a few technical hurdles , but they require just work and time , and the outcome is reasonably predictable . ' although the team say synthetic meat is biologically the same , it will need to replicate its appearance closely to tempt doubters . cultured beef is currently white , and coloured using beetroot . professor post 's team are now working on cultivating fat tissue and increasing levels of the pigment myoglobin , which gives meat its colour . this would offer a more authentic flavour and appearance . but beef patties are n't the only part of our diet to attract the attention of food scientists . in the future , every aspect of a burger -- from the bun to the relish -- could be modified to make it more sustainable . what 's more , it could even become something of a health food . the science is tantalisingly close to delivering , but any new gm foods would have to overcome a raft of regulations , particularly in europe . in london in august , the world 's first lab-grown hamburger -lrb- pictured -rrb- - which was developed by a team at maastricht university in the netherlands - was cooked and served . health-boosting purple tomatoes . a team from the john innes centre in norwich , uk , has engineered tomatoes using genes from the snapdragon flower to give an extra helping of pigments called anthocyanins . these have an anti-inflammatory effect in the body . in tests , the tomatoes slowed the progression of soft-tissue carcinoma in cancer-prone mice . the tomatoes and juice will not be available commercially until regulatory approval , which could be as soon as two years in north america , says lead researcher professor cathie martin . cultured beef . muscle stem cells from cattle have been cultured in a nutrient broth by researchers at maastricht university in the netherlands , and then mixed with collagen so they formed strips of muscle tissue -- the main component of meat . these were then ` bulked up ' with electrical stimulation , before being minced up and shaped into a patty . a total of 20,000 muscle strips are needed to create just one burger . dr davies says creating lab grown meat -lrb- pictured -rrb- is a vital development because current meat production methods are not sustainable and meeting global demand is becoming become increasingly difficult . diabetes-treating lettuce . dr henry daniell , a molecular biologist at the university of pennsylvania , works on delivering drugs using plants . he has created lettuces genetically engineered to express a protein that stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin . tests on mice given freeze-dried ` super lettuce ' have shown promising results . allergy-free milk . milk allergies are often caused by a protein called beta-lactoglobulin -lrb- blg -rrb- , which is not present in human milk . a new zealand team has used genetic engineering to create a cow that produces blg-free milk . they are currently creating more cows with the same genetics using reproductive technologies analogous to human ivf treatment . the article is featured in this month 's edition of science uncovered magazine . reinforced bread . in 2012 , scientists from the uk , germany and the u.s. deciphered wheat 's complex genetic code , identifying about 96,000 genes . the work paves the way to breeding wheat varieties with higher yields , more disease resistance , and increased ability to cope with drought and other climate-related stresses . creepy-crawly cuisine is coming . insects are highly nutritious and heading to a dinner plate near you . the idea of eating tangles of muscle from a petri dish may be unpalatable to some . even less appealing , however , may be the idea of devouring insects , deep-fried or otherwise . yet in restaurants from london to sydney , insects are proving quite a hit with a niche audience keen to eat delights such as grasshoppers , locusts , crickets and scorpions -lrb- heat-treated , of course , to remove the toxins -rrb- . insects actually form part of the traditional diets of at least two billion people worldwide , according to the food and agriculture organisation -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations . there 's no escaping the fact that they are good for you . a recent fao report points to the benefits of eating insects . they are high in fat , protein , fibre , and key minerals and vitamins , from iron and calcium to b vitamins and vitamin e. crucially , insects have a negligible impact on the environment . they are cold-blooded and very efficient at converting feed to protein , not using energy to maintain their body temperature . they can also be fed on organic waste . so-called mini livestock also offer ` livelihood opportunities ' , says a recent fao report on edible insects , meaning they could also be an ethical choice . this article is featured in this month 's edition of science uncovered magazine .	 purple tomatoes with anti-inflammatory properties have been developed , says dr emma davies , writing in the magazine science uncovered .   they can slow the development of some cancerous tumours .   there is now lettuce that boosts the body 's production of insulin .   insects , which are very nutritious , are increasingly popular in restaurants . 
370	a devoted grandmother died from cervical cancer after her gp repeatedly dismissed her symptoms as the menopause . cheryl humpage , 55 , died in july 2010 after huge tumours spread - despite her undergoing an aggressive course of chemotherapy . almost 18 months earlier in february 2008 , the grandmother-of-three and former factory worker sought medical help after complaining of nausea , unusual bleeding and fever . her gp , dr martin crowther , of st peter 's surgery in walsall , west midlands , dismissed her symptoms as the menopause and she was prescribed hrt . cheryl humpage saw her gp several times complaining of nausea , unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer . by the time she was diagnosed , it was too late to save her . february 15 , 2008 - mrs humpage first visited her gp complaining of fever , vomiting and aching . he gave her painkillers and suggested it was probably the menopause . february 22 , 2008 - she returned to the gp as her symptoms had not improved . he offered a course of hormone replacement therapy -lrb- hrt -rrb- but she did not want it . september 2008 - mrs humpage had been experiencing having heavy bleeding so went back to see the gp again . this time he prescribed hrt . february 23 , 2009 - after another visit , she was finally referred for a scan at walsall manor hospital . march 5 , 2009 - mrs humpage underwent an ultrasound which highlighted a large tumour on her ovary . she was admitted to city hospital as an emergency . april 19 , 2009 - the primary cancer is found to be on her cervix and she is referred for chemotherapy . july 26 , 2010 - mrs humpage dies aged 55 . but her symptoms persisted and despite being examined by dr crowther a further three times , she was not diagnosed with cancer until a year later . in march 2009 , doctors finally diagnosed her with cancer after she was referred to a specialist at walsall manor hospital but it was too late to save her and she died four months later . today her devastated husband peter , 56 , received a five-figure compensation pay-out from the gp 's insurers after suing dr crowther for medical negligence . mr humpage said : ` cheryl was very concerned about her symptoms but she thought she was in safe hands . ` she was a great mum and grandmother and very family orientated , we 're all absolutely heartbroken that she 's no longer with us . ` it 's very hard not to be angry about what happened . cheryl should not have had to suffer like she did and if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier we believe we could have had longer with her . ` we just hope that what happened to cheryl acts as a reminder to all of us about the importance of a quick diagnosis of cervical cancer . ` it is however still difficult to come to terms with out loss because we have never had any sort of apology or admission of responsibility to help us draw a line under everything that happened . ` until then , i 'm not sure that we can ever truly move forward . ' dr crowther today apologised for failing to detect mrs humpage 's cancer . he said : ' i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to mrs humpage 's family for their loss . ' i am sorry for the delay in making a diagnosis . i . have reflected extensively on the episode and discussed it with . colleagues and i have learned from this process , now being more aware of . the danger in similar situations . ' a year after mrs humpage 's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at walsall manor hospital -lrb- pictured -rrb- , where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer . lindsay tomlinson , from irwin mitchell solicitors , who represented the family , said : ` this is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife , mother and grandmother . ` during out investigations an independent medical expert found that cheryl 's gp should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers . ` any yet no pelvic examination was made , she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue . ` had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family . ' ms tomlinson added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier , her suffering would have been ` greatly reduced and it was ` incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly ' . about 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the uk and it is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45 . the symptoms of are n't always obvious and the disease may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage . in most cases , abnormal bleeding is the first sign . its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated . other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex , an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine . if the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation , blood in the urine , loss of bladder control , bone pain , a loss of appetite and a lack of energy . because of routine screening in the uk it is usually picked up in the precancerous stage . therefore it is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years . women aged between 50 and 64 are offered screening every five years .	 cheryl humpage saw her gp several times complaining of nausea , unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer .   but it took another year before she was referred to a specialist .   by the time she was diagnosed in july 2010 it was too late to save her .   her family have now received a five-figure payout from the gp 's insurer after suing for medical negligence .

' designer wayne hemingway and his daughter tilly scoured market stalls , auctions and ebay in order to give the flat and authentic 1960s look . everything , from the lps stacked on shelves , to the beatles bed cover , and posters of twiggy in the teenage bedroom is from the period . for smaller items , such as the bottle of aftershave and can of gillette in the bathroom , the pair were forced to raid the land of lost content museum , in shropshire . goldfinger was born in hungary but emigrated to paris after the fall of the austro-hungarian empire , and moved to britain in 1934 after marrying ursula blackwell , heiress to the crosse and blackwell food company fortune . goldfinger -lrb- left -rrb- , a hungarian communist , moved to britain in 1934 . he designed the headquarters of the british communist party , before building the balfron tower and its sister building , the trellick tower . james bond author ian fleming so hated goldfinger that the writer named one of his villains after him . designer wayne hemingway and his daughter tilly scoured auctions , markets and ebay to give the flat an authentic sixties feel . everything from the furniture , to the wallpaper , and even the board games , is from the period . a supporter of communism , he spent his years before the second world war living in highgate , and after the conflict began designing buildings for the likes of the daily worker newspaper and the british communist party . for goldfinger , who was so despised by james bond author ian fleming that the writer adopted his name for a villain in his books , high rise living was the future of britain in the sixties . he saw building upwards as a way to keep more green space open for people to enjoy at ground level , a mission he shared with the founder of the national trust , octavia hill . he also saw high rise towers as a way to solve the chronic lack of housing in post-second world war britain , and move the poor out of slums and into better quality apartments . the balfron was his first experiment with tower blocks , having built several terraced homes in hampstead , north west london , including his own house at 2 williow road , which the national trust also looks after . it was the design of this property that first drew the anger of fleming , after he opposed the demoluition of several cottages to make way for it . goldfinger saw high-rise living as a way to provide low-cost housing to the poor and solve the chronic lack of homes in post-war britain , while also keeping green space . for smaller items , such as records , a bottle of aftershave and a can of gillette , the designers also raided the land of lost content museum , in shropshire . the block would later be used as a blueprint the blueprint for its sister building , the trellick tower in west london , and sparked a wave of copy-cat buildings across the country . however , while apartments in the trellick tower now sell for upwards of # 500,000 , balfron became known for violence , crime and poverty . balfron itself is in the process of being renovated , with current residents being housed elsewhere until the building is finished . council tenants who want to move back in will be allowed to do so , while those who want to leave will be rehomed , and their flats sold off to private investors . the apartments currently sell for # 155,000 . the balfron tower pop-up exhibition will run for two weeks , beginning on october 1 . ticketsare available here . while balfron tower sparked a wave of copy-cat social housing across the country , as an experiment in high-rise living it ultimately proved a failure , becoming synonymous with poverty , crime and violence .	 erno goldfinger designed balfron tower in east london and lived in flat 130 on the top floor for two months in 1968 .   now the national trust has given it a 1960s makeover and will open it to the public as part of a brutalist exhibition .   balfron tower was the architect 's first tower block and inspired sister building , the trellick tower , in west london .   goldfinger saw high rises as a way to end the housing shortage in post-war britain while preserving green spaces .

usually a woman . it was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless . in many myths , including oedipus , those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster , would be killed and eaten . the sphinx described by the ancient egyptians was usually male and more benevolent . in both cultures , they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs . the oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in turkey and dates to 9,500 bc . ` the excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside , ' mr samaras said . last week the culture ministry called for ` understanding ' while the amphipolis excavation proceeds . the discovery has sparked global interest and wild speculation that it may contain rich treasures or the bones of an ancient celebrity . the doorway of the tomb is covered in earth , with traces of painted plaster decoration . ` it 's astonishing , the biggest tomb we have found in greece so far , ' said archaeologist chryssoula paliadelli , an expert on the period who is not involved in the excavation . ` it clearly shows the wealth that allowed construction of what was , at the time , a hugely costly monument . ' while the tomb appears to be undisturbed , there are fears that it could have been looted hundreds of years ago . part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance is missing , while the sphinxes , which were originally six feet -lrb- 2metres -rrb- high , lack heads and wings . near the sphinxes , excavators have found fragments of a large marble lion that originally capped the mound , which they say indicates the site was severely damaged and dug up in later antiquity . the excavation is expected to last at least another few weeks . excavator katerina peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago , and is now situated around 3 miles -lrb- 5km -rrb- from the excavation site -lrb- pictured -rrb- . the lion has been associated with laomedon of mytilene , who was one of alexander 's military commanders .	 the tomb is situated in amphipolis region of serres in greece .   mysterious headless sphinxes have been found at its entrance .   prime minister antonis samaras described the find as ` incredibly important , ' and one archaeologist thinks it could be of ` global importance '   the tomb and its burial site is said to date back between 325 and 300 bc .   this means it could have been built during the reign of alexander the great .   experts believe it could hold the remains of a senior ancient official .

401	a u.s. health authority poster claiming ebola can be transmitted by droplets through the air has been removed from its website , prompting concerns the deadly virus can be caught through a sneeze . the poster , which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus can not be transmitted by air , said ebola could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected . the centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- poster said droplets , such as those from a sneeze , carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours . the cdc image which shows their warning that droplets from a sneeze could transmit ebola . debate about government-imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks , as isolated cases are diagnosed in the u.s. and it continues to spread across west africa . so far , more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in liberia , sierra leone and guinea - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record . the cdc poster , now removed , stated : ` droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes , nose or mouth of another person , ' the new york post reported . it warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes , nose or mouth . today , the cdc internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated . it read : ` the what 's the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets ? fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable . please visit cdc.gov / ebola for up-to-date information on ebola . ' medical experts have repeatedly stated the ebola virus is not transmittable by air . it is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids , such as urine , saliva , sweat , feces , vomit , breast milk and semen , of a person who is infected . an image of the ebola virus , which has killed nearly 5,000 people in west africa and recently reached the u.s. . but experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the ebola virus could mutate and become airborne . although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low , experts can not discount it entirely . two weeks ago leading scientist lord robert winston warned the risk of ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne . in a house of lords debate , the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus . lord winston said : ` we know that viruses mutate , we know that the ebola virus can mutate . ` we know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment , and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus . ` however , can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change ? ' and the chief of the un 's ebola mission , anthony banbury , also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne . he said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ` nightmare scenario ' . health workers in liberia pictured suiting up to continue working around people who have caught the virus .	 cdc poster claimed ebola virus could be spread via contaminated droplets .   droplets could be spread by sneezing , and virus lives on surfaces for hours .   experts say ebola only transmitted by contact bodily fluids such as blood .   cdc pulled the poster from its website , says it is ` being updated '

405	happily ever after : pro-marriage campaigner harry benson and his wife kate , who argue that policy must be changed to support married couples . children are more likely to be in single-parent families in britain than anywhere else in western europe , figures have revealed . almost one in four live with a lone mother or father , compared to about one in six across the rest of the eu . britain is now ahead of belgium , denmark , ireland and france , where the number of youngsters living with just one parent is dropping -- or rising more slowly . the figures point to the dramatic impact of family breakdown and have been linked to a ` meteoric rise ' in cohabiting relationships . a pro-marriage group is calling on politicians to do more to encourage couples to wed -- and stay together . the marriage foundation obtained a breakdown of the most recent figures -- for 2012 -- from the eu 's statistics arm eurostat . according to its analysis published yesterday , 24 per cent of dependent children in the uk lived in single-parent families -- up three percentage points on 2010 and marginally ahead of belgium . the figure for belgium , rounded to 24 per cent by eurostat , was up by just two percentage points since 2010 . in denmark , france and ireland , the percentage fell . the only eu country with a higher figure than britain was the eastern state of latvia , where sky-high divorce rates have pushed up the number of single parents . in britain , by contrast , divorce rates have been falling and family break-up is largely a matter of collapsing cohabiting relationships . harry benson , of the marriage foundation , said : ` while most lone parents do an amazing job with fewer resources , few have chosen lone parenthood as their lifestyle choice . ` our research clearly shows that in the uk 's case -- and that of other countries in western europe -- this rising rate of lone parenthood is a symptom not of a rising divorce rate , but instead by the meteoric rise in the numbers of children brought up by unmarried parents . ' he said it was ` essential ' for policymakers to face up to the realities of a generation brought up in single-parent households to avert a ` host of negative social and economic implications ' . he added : ` western europe policy must focus on supporting existing marriages . being brought up in a stable two-parent household is essential in affording children the decent start in life they deserve . ' the number of british children in lone-parent families rose rapidly in the 1980s , helped by rising divorce rates and increasing numbers of single young women who chose to bring up children alone with help from the benefits system . scroll down for video . however , divorce rates in britain started falling in the 1990s and are now back to mid-1970s levels . the marriage foundation report said : ` while the phrase `` lone parenthood '' is a good indicator of the trend , it understates the full extent of family breakdown , as many lone parents go on to form new relationships . ` those who do so have still experienced family breakdown , but are no longer classified as lone parents . ' children who have been through break-ups are said to be less likely to do well at school and more likely to suffer from adverse effects such as poor physical and mental health , unemployment and drug abuse and crime . couples are married in only 56 per cent of british families , according to the results of the 2011 national census . meanwhile , the number of cohabiting couples with children has risen to more than a million . such relationships are estimated to be three times more likely to end in break-up than marriages , and a typical cohabiting relationship that does not lead to marriage lasts no more than three years . marriages , by contrast , last 11 years on average and a high proportion of couples are separated only by death . david cameron has spoken regularly about the need to encourage marriage . but so far coalition ministers have offered only a minor tax break , worth up to # 200 a year , to lower-income married couples . some senior tories , including former chancellor lord lawson , have called for fully transferable tax allowances for married couples with children .	 in 2012 around 24 per cent of uk children lived in single-parent households .   eastern state of latvia was only country in europe to have higher figure .   campaigners call on government to do more to make sure couples marry . 
406	a quarter of children in britain are living in poverty , a controversial report by a united nations agency claimed yesterday . millions ` have fallen prey to the dangers of austerity ' during the recession years , unicef said . britain was even ranked 25th on a child poverty league table of 41 developed countries -- below romania , bulgaria and chile . the proportion of children in poverty is higher in the uk than in france , germany , holland or australia . however , critics last night described a measurement that assesses children in the uk as worse off than those in eastern europe as ` worthless ' . they said unicef was using distorted measures to paint a false picture of the real levels of poverty in britain . calculations are relative to average income -- so britain appears to be worse than countries where most people are poor , because average incomes in the uk are higher . in the latest of a succession of highly critical reports about britain by un agencies , unicef said child poverty in the uk increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2008 and 2012 to 25.6 per cent . topping a table of countries deemed to have best protected children during the recession was chile , where child poverty was said to have dropped by 8.6 points . unicef attacked the government 's cuts to benefits for contributing to a rise in child poverty since 2008 . policy : jeffrey o'malley is behind the report . the un official behind the children of the recession report is unicef director of policy and strategy jeffrey o'malley . the canadian has spent his career working for the un and other global organisations . mr o'malley is an active user of twitter , which he uses to publicise not only the un agency 's activities but his other interests , which include campaigning against climate change , and supporting the global drug policy commission , which wants to see drug abuse decriminalised . before joining unicef mr o'malley spent 20 years working for hiv and aids campaign groups . for 11 years he ran the hiv/aids alliance , which is claimed to be ` the world 's largest international development non-governmental organisation specialising in hiv and aids ' . he then moved to the un development programme , an agency which has also provoked controversy in britain . in 2011 it published a ` human development index ' that put britain in 28th place , below recession-ravaged greece , spain , italy and ireland . mr o'malley took over the policy role at unicef in 2012 . in romania , in 12th place , child poverty fell 2.3 points , while the measure dropped by 0.6 in 20th-placed bulgaria . the children of the recession report said many affluent countries had suffered a ` great leap backwards ' in terms of household income . jeffrey o'malley , unicef 's head of global policy and strategy , added : ` the impact on children will have long-lasting repercussions for them and their communities . ` all countries need strong social safety nets to protect children in bad times and in good -- and wealthy countries should lead by example , explicitly committing to eradicate child poverty , developing policies to offset economic downturns , and making child well-being a top priority . ' unicef 's use of ` relative poverty ' in its report is unpopular in britain . work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith has been trying to stop whitehall using such measurements because they are seen by many to record levels of inequality , rather than poverty . relative poverty counts people as poor if they live on an income below a poverty line , set at 60 per cent of median income . but if the median income in a country rises , so do the number of people who appear to be in ` poverty ' . conversely , if everyone is poor , but median incomes are low , it will suggest fewer people in poverty . however , critics condemned the methods used by the un agency to arrive at its figures . jill kirby , former chief of the centre for policy studies think-tank , described the findings as ` worthless ' and said unicef should be using measures of ` real deprivation ' . a source close to work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said unicef is using ` out of date statistics ' and said national data showed that around 300,000 fewer children are now in poverty . in another unflattering table of national comparisons , yesterday 's report also highlighted britain 's ` neets ' -- young people who are not in employment , education or training . unicef found that neets rose from 12.1 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2012 , placing the uk 14th out of 41 on the league table -- below turkey and mexico . ` many will suffer the consequences for life , ' the report said . in fact turkey has more than doubled the percentage of neets aged 15 to 24 compared to britain , and mexico close to double . but by looking at relative changes in the years 2008 to 2012 , unicef put both countries higher in its league table . the report said britain should ` review ' its economic policies as a ` priority ' and raise working tax credit , increase benefits in line with inflation , and push up the minimum wage for under 21s . other un reports have criticised britain . last year the un 's special rapporteur on adequate housing , brazilian raquel rolnik , angered tory politicians when she demanded the abolition of the so-called ` bedroom tax ' . and south african official rashida manjoo claimed that sexism in britain is worse than elsewhere and that public spending cuts were making things worse . bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children , according to a major new report published last week . politicians have been reluctant to ` call out ' bad parenting , despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling , the former labour minister alan milburn said . mr milburn , who was brought in by david cameron as the government 's social mobility tsar , attacked mps for being ` tentative and timid ' about bad parenting . deputy prime minister nick clegg -lrb- left -rrb- has attacked the tories for blocking the introduction of ` meaningful ' new child poverty targets following alan milburn 's report into social mobility . child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s , the national children 's bureau warned last week . it said britain is at risk of becoming a place where ` children 's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate , parallel worlds . ' it found that around 3.6 million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s . he called for a national parenting campaign , funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than # 100,000 a year . mr milburn 's report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas , action to close the gap in gcse results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020 . it also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal , and that the ` living wage ' should be introduced by 2025 . the recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless ` urgent action ' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment . mr milburn said the uk was at risk of becoming a ` permanently divided ' nation , with the poorest in society left behind . it says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade , amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay .	 children 's rights body blamed coalition cuts for increase in child poverty .   uk now 25th out of 41 developed countries for children living in poverty .   child poverty increased by 1.6 % to 25.6 % following the 2008 recession . 
407	mistake : former home secretary says the 2004 decision was ` well-intentioned ' but ` messed up ' jack straw has admitted that throwing open britain 's borders to eastern european migrants was a ` spectacular mistake ' . the former home secretary said labour 's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to poles and migrants from other new eu states was a ` well-intentioned policy we messed up ' . his comments emerged on the same day as his successor as home secretary , david blunkett , warned that the influx of roma migrants into britain risked causing riots . mr blunkett 's comments reinforced the significance of mr straw 's admission about labour 's failure to anticipate the scale of migration when eight former soviet bloc nations became eu members , and britain -- almost alone in europe -- allowed the free movement of workers between countries . at the time , the government predicted up to 13,000 migrants would come to britain each year . the actual total over nearly a decade was more than a million . virtually every other eu state , apart from ireland and sweden , kept their jobs markets closed for the seven years permitted . in an article for his local paper , the lancashire telegraph , mr straw -- who is mp for blackburn -- admitted the forecasts were ` worthless ' . and he accepted the ` social dislocation ' which can be caused when ` large numbers of people from abroad settle in a particular area ' . mr straw said : ` one spectacular mistake in which i participated -lrb- not alone -rrb- was in lifting the transitional restrictions on the eastern european states like poland and hungary which joined the eu in mid-2004 . ` other existing eu members , notably france and germany , decided to stick to the general rule which prevented migrants from these new states from working until 2011 . ` but we thought that it would be good for britain if these folk could come and work here from 2004 . not alone : mr straw 's successor david blunkett -lrb- left -rrb- has also spoken out about problems caused by immigration , warning that roma migrants could cause riots . ukip leader nigel farage -lrb- right -rrb- applauded him . it is estimated that more than 700,000 people from romania could try to find work and settle in britain . ` thorough research by the home office . suggested that the impact of this benevolence would in any event be . `` relatively small , at between 5,000 and 13,000 immigrants per year up to . 2010 '' . events proved these forecasts worthless . ` net migration reached close to a quarter of a million at its peak in 2010 . lots of red faces , mine included . ' also critical : last year ed miliband said labour 's policy left communities ` struggling to cope ' his comments are the furthest any senior labour figure has gone in accepting the party made serious errors in immigration policy during its time in power . mr blunkett told the bbc that roma groups from slovakia who had settled in a district of sheffield were behaving like they were living in a ` downtrodden village or woodland ' where there were no toilets or litter collections . they were dumping rubbish on the streets , loitering late at night and causing ` friction ' with residents , he added . the tensions have prompted existing residents of the page hall area to set up street patrols to try to combat the anti-social behaviour . since 2004 , several hundred roma families have settled in the area , many with eight children or more . mr blunkett said : ` we have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming roma community -- because there 's going to be an explosion otherwise . ` we have got to be tough and robust in saying to people , `` you are not living in a downtrodden village or woodland '' -- because many of them do n't live in areas where there are toilets or refuse collection facilities . ' mr blunkett said the ` understandable tensions ' between different groups could lead to a repeat of the 2001 riots in oldham and bradford . ` if everything exploded , if things went wrong , the community would obviously be devastated . we saw this in bradford , burnley and oldham all those years ago when i first became home secretary . ' back track : mr straw wrote in his local newspaper that the decision was made based on data showing 5,000 to 13,000 migrants a year would come to britain . ` events proved these forecasts worthless ' . tough : support for the labour party hit a three-year low in 2004 following the immigration announcement . mr blunkett 's comments were welcomed by ukip leader nigel farage , who said they reinforced the need for a re-think over the dropping of similar border controls with romania and bulgaria on january 1 next year . immigration campaigners have predicted the arrival of up to 50,000 people a year as a result of ending the transitional controls over nationals from the two countries . romania has one of the largest roma populations in europe , with an estimated two million living there . last year ed miliband was criticised for dropping an admission that labour 's policy had left communities across britain ` struggling to cope ' . in advance of a speech in december , his spin doctors suggested he would admit that the party 's failures on immigration had damaged britain and increased community tensions . ` the home office suggested the impact would be relatively small ... between 5,000 and 13,000 migrants a years . events proved these forecasts worthless ' - jack straw in his local newspaper . he had been expected to say : ` we did too little to tackle the realities of segregation in communities that were struggling to cope . ' but the admission was dropped in favour of a vague acknowledgment that the party had made ` mistakes ' . mr straw 's comments will prompt further calls for labour to apologise for its failure on immigration . mr farage said : ` mr blunkett should be admired for the courage he has shown by speaking so plainly . ` the fact that he is talking of the significant difficulties with the roma population already in his constituency should be taken seriously by the likes of cameron , clegg and miliband . ` my question is if they wo n't listen to the dangers of opening the door to romania and bulgaria next year when ukip speak out on it , will they listen to david blunkett ? ' a recent salford university study suggested britain 's population of roma -- estimated at 200,000 -- is one of the largest in western europe .	 former home secretary said the party 's 2004 decision to hand immediate working rights to migrants from other eu states was a mistake .   admission in his local paper is furthest any labour minister has gone .   his successor david blunkett also warned roma migrants could cause riots .   government had predicted influx of 13,000 a year - 1m came in a decade . 
408	a tory grandee today warned that he would sue for libel if newspapers repeat false internet rumours linking him to paedophilia . in an unusual move , sir peter bottomley issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites . sir peter said people were using the current controversy about an alleged cover-up of child sex abuse at westminster to ` restart ' disproved rumours about him from the 1980s . sir peter bottomley , married to the former conservative cabinet minister virginia bottomley , issued a public denial of any involvement in child sex abuse in a bid to counter false claims circulating on websites . sir peter , who is married to the former conservative cabinet minister virginia bottomley , told radio four 's today programme that people were also now wrongly suggesting that he may have visited the elm guest house , in barnes , south-west london , which is at the centre of some of the current claims . the elm guest house is alleged to have been the scene of paedophile activity and sex parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures in the 1970s and 1980s . visitors are said to have included the late liberal mp sir cyril smith . sir peter , 69 , successfully sued the mail on sunday in 1989 after it printed a false story about him . today he said he would have no hesitation in doing so again if the rumours appear in print . he said : ` people are trying to restart -lsb- the rumours -rsb- ; people are trying to somehow to connect it to the elm guest house , a place i 've not been to , where i ' ve not been involved . and i give this public warning - if any substantial publisher links me in any defamatory way , they can expect the same kind of action as the mail on sunday got . ' sir peter dismissed suggestions there had been a conspiracy to cover up abuse by establishment figures . sir peter , who said he had always gone out of his way to help whistleblowers , said he backed the idea of a wide-ranging inquiry into claims that senior figures were involved in child sex abuse , provided it did not interfere with police investigations . but he dismissed suggestions that there had been a major conspiracy to cover up abuse by establishment figures . he said successive governments did not take seriously enough the activities of groups like the notorious paedophile information exchange , ` partly because people could n't believe it , partly because there may have been one or two senior people in the police or some other forms of public life ' . but he added : ` the idea that there could be an organised group that could stop things happening is , i think , imagination . ` if i tried to organise a conspiracy on something i knew a lot about i think it would fall apart in two or three days . if this were an organised conspiracy there would be much more there .

412	many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier . but research has found children can spot this tactic , and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them . once spotted , a study from the massachusetts institute of technology found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves . children can tell when adults are omitting information or bending the truth , -lrb- illustrated with a stock image -rrb- , according to a new report from the massachusetts institute of technology . once this tactic has been spotted , the children will try to fill in gaps in the information themselves . children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions . one group of children received a toy that had four buttons , each of which activated a different function , while the other group was given a toy with one button . then the children watched as a ` teacher ' demonstrated the toy -- only pointing out one function . the children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was , using a scale from 1 to 20 . children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy 's only function . in a follow-up experiment , the same ` teacher ' demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions . children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly , suggesting that they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative . determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people , explained hyowon gweon , lead author of the paper which is published in the journal cognition . ` when someone provides us information , we not only learn about what is being taught , we also learn something about that person . if the information is accurate and complete , then you might also trust that person in the future , ' she said . ` but if this person has taught you something wrong , has made a mistake , or has omitted something that 's important for you to know , then you might want to suspend your trust , be sceptical of the information he provides in the future , and even seek other sources of information . ' the study builds on a 2011 paper in which the team of researchers investigated how children behave when a teacher explained only one function of a toy that can do four different things . they found children spent most of their time exploring only the function the teacher had demonstrated . however , children who received no instruction spent more time exploring all of the toy 's features and ended up discovering more of them . the study builds on a 2011 paper in which the team of researchers investigated how children behave when a teacher explains only one function of a toy that can do four different things . the new research looks at their reaction to the teacher . an image of a child playing is pictured . in the new study , dr gweon wanted to investigate what children thought of the teacher who did not fully explain what the toy could do . she said : ` previous studies about children 's trust in informants or teachers focused on whether children distinguish , and learn differentially from someone who says something false from someone who 's telling the truth . ` going beyond those sensitivities to truth and falseness , what i wanted to see in this study is whether children are also sensitive to someone who 's telling the truth but not the whole truth - someone who did n't tell them everything that they ought to know . ' in the experiment , children who had to work out additional functions of the toy distrusted a teacher 's explanation about a second one -lrb- stock image -rrb- . in the first experiment , children aged six and seven were given a toy to explore on their own until they discovered all of its functions . one group of children received a toy that had four buttons , each of which activated a different function , while the other group was given a toy with only one button and function . then the children watched as a ` teacher ' puppet demonstrated the toy to a ` student ' puppet . for both toys , the teacher 's instruction was the same . he demonstrated only one function - the windup mechanism . after the demonstration , the children were asked to rate how helpful the teacher was , using a scale from one to 20 . children who knew the toy had three more undemonstrated functions gave much lower ratings than children who knew it was the toy 's only function . in a follow-up experiment , the same ` teacher ' demonstrated a second toy and only demonstrated one of its four functions . children who had previously seen a demonstration they knew to be incomplete explored the toy more thoroughly , suggesting they did not trust the teacher to be fully informative . ` this shows that children are not just sensitive to who 's right or wrong , ' dr gweon said . ` -lsb- they -rsb- can evaluate others based on who 's providing information that is enough or not enough for accurate inference . they can also adjust how they learn from a teacher in the future , depending on whether the teacher has previously committed a sin of omission or not . '	 a study by massachusetts institute of technology found children can spot when information is being deliberately held back .   if they think they 're being lied to , they will try to fill in the gaps themselves .   children use this to decide who is a trustworthy source for the future .   they are more sceptical of adults who have held back information before .   researchers used toys with various functions to come to their conclusions . 
413	a ` cursed ' roman ring that was dug up by a farmer is believed to have been the inspiration behind jrr tolkien 's the hobbit . the piece of gold jewellery was discovered close to the roman town of silchester , hampshire , in 1785 . the celebrated author was called in to investigate the incredible story of the ring 's past just two years before his famous novel was published . tolkein 's inspiration ? the tale of this ` cursed ' roman ring discovered in a field by a farmer in silchester , hampshire , in 1785 , may have inspired jrr tolkien to write the hobbit . the story of the jewellery 's unlikely link to the 20th century author is told in a new exhibition opening today at the vyne , a national trust-owned property in hampshire . it is thought it was unearthed by a farmer ploughing his field close to the roman town in the 18th century . historians believe the large 12g gold ring once belonged to a roman called silvianus but he put a curse on it after it was stolen . it is so large that it will only fit on the finger of a gloved hand . it has a latin inscription which says ` senicianus live well in god ' . jrr tolkien , who was an oxford university professor with expertise in anglo-saxon history , is thought to have drawn inspiration from the tale when he started work on the hobbit . an unlikely source ? frodo baggins with the ring in one of the lord of the rings films based on jrr tolkien 's novels . the book , which has a ring at the centre of the plot , was published in 1937 and was well-received by critics . the novel , which was turned into a film last year , was the precursor for the lord of the ring trilogy . after the ring was discovered in a field it is thought to have been sold to the chute family who owned the vyne for centuries before it passed into the hands of the national trust in the 1930s . it was several decades after the farmer found it before the curse was discovered on a tablet in lydney , gloucestershire , more than 100 miles away . the victim , silvianus , knew the thief responsible and called on the god nodens to strike him down . the great archaeologist sir mortimer wheeler , the director of later excavations at lydney , realised the connection between the ring and the curse tablet , and in 1929 asked jrr tolkien to work on the etymology of the name nodens . film adaptation : gollum in the hobbit film who snatches the ring - not knowing its value . film series : a shot from the lord of the rings , the fellowship of the ring . the ring which may have inspired the books goes on display today . the tablet says : ` among those who bear the name of senicianus . to none grant health until he bring back the ring to the temple of . nodens . ' senicianus apparently only got as far as the field in silchester when he abandoned the ring . for many years , the ring , with an image of the goddess venus , lay almost forgotten in a corner of the library at the vyne . the new exhibition explores whether the book inspired tolkien to write the lord of the rings . it also contains memorabilia from the tolkien society 's own archive , and a first edition copy of the book signed by the author . dave green , manager of the vyne , said they wanted to tell the public the remarkable tale of the ring . ' i was looking for the ring to show a . visitor , and i walked right past the case with it -- that 's when i . decided we really had to make more of this amazing thing , ' he told the guardian . exhibition : the ring has gone on display today at the vyne , a property owned by the national trust , in hampshire . dr lynn forest-hill , education officer for the tolkien society : ` the influences most often cited for tolkien 's creation of the one ring usually take the form of literary or legendary rings such as the ring of the niebelungs , or the old king 's ring in the 14th century story of bevis of hampton . ` it is , then , particularly fascinating to see the physical evidence of the vyne ring , with its links to tolkien through the inscription associating it with a curse . ` it is well known that in 1929 tolkien worked on the etymology of the name nodens mentioned on a roman curse stone . ` significantly , in the context of his non-academic writing , he would have read the latin inscription on the curse tablet : deuo nodenti silvianus anilum perdidit ... . inter quibus nomen seniciani nollis permittas sanitatem perfera -lsb- t -rsb- translated as : to the god nodens : silvianus has lost a ring ... . among those who bear the name senicianus to none grant health .

' i am gabriel , ' the writing declares . the stone inscription is one of the oldest passages featuring the archangel , and represents an ` explosion of angels in second temple judaism , ' at a time of great spiritual angst for jews in jerusalem looking for divine connection , said adolfo roitman , a curator of the exhibit . the stone inscription is one of the oldest passages featuring the archangel , and represents an ` explosion of angels in second temple judaism , ' at a time of great spiritual angst for jews in jerusalem looking for divine connection , said adolfo roitman , a curator of the exhibit . a bedouin man is said to have found it in jordan on the eastern banks of the dead sea around the year 2000 , knohl said . an israeli university professor later examined a piece of earth stuck to the stone and found a composition of minerals only found in that region of the dead sea . the stone eventually made it into the hands of ghassan rihani , a jordanian antiquities dealer based in jordan and london , who in turn sold the stone to swiss-israeli collector david jeselsohn in zurich for an unspecified amount . rihani has since died . the bible scholar traveled to jordan multiple times to look for more potential stones , but was unable to find the stone 's original location . a 3rd century archangel gabriel icon in the monastery of saint catherine , sinai , egypt . the exhibit traces the development . of the archangel gabriel in the three monotheistic religions , displaying . a dead sea scroll fragment which mentions the angel 's name ; the 13th . century damascus codex , one of the oldest illustrated manuscripts of the . complete hebrew bible ; a 10th century new testament manuscript from . brittany , in which gabriel predicts the birth of john the baptist and . appears to the virgin mary ; and an iranian quran manuscript dated to the . 15th or 16th century , in which the angel , called jibril in arabic , . reveals the word of god to the prophet mohammad . ` gabriel . is not archaeology , he is still relevant for millions of people on . earth who believe that angels are heavenly beings on earth , ' said . roitman . the gabriel stone , he said , is ` the starting point of an ongoing tradition that still is relevant today . ' israel museum curators said jeselsohn lent the stone to the museum for temporary display . lenny wolfe , an antiquities dealer in jerusalem , said that before the jordanian dealer bought it , another middleman faxed him an image of the stone and offered it for sale . ` the fax did n't come out clearly . i had no idea what it was , ' said wolfe , who passed on the offer . ` it was one of my biggest misses , ' wolfe said . what function the stone had , where it was displayed , and why it was written are unknown , said curators of the israel museum exhibit . ` there is still so much that is unclear , ' said michal dayagi-mendels , a curator of the exhibit . scholars , she said , ` will still argue about this for years .

415	researchers have claimed earth is 60 million years older than previously thought . our planet was believed to have formed approximately 100 million years after the solar system started to take shape 4.6 billion years ago , but scientists now say it was actually closer to just 40 million years . they came to the conclusion by analysing ancient gases in quartz , which showed astronomers had underestimated the timing of the impact that formed the moon - and in turn the age of earth . scientists know earth was born from a disk of dust and gas about 4.6 billion years ago -lrb- artist 's illustration shown -rrb- , but the exact timing of this is unknown . new research suggests it may have occurred just 40 million years after the solar system formed , 60 million years older than initially thought . the research was presented by geochemists from the university of lorraine in nancy , france to the goldschmidt geochemistry conference in sacramento , california . many researchers believe the moon formed after earth was hit by a planet the size of mars billions of years ago . this is called the giant impact hypothesis . the hypothesis claims the moon is . debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and . an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago . the . colliding body is sometimes called theia , after the mythical greek . titan who was the mother of selene , the goddess of the moon . they discovered an isotopic signal that indicates previous age estimates for both the earth and the moon need to be revised . calculating exact dates that far back , however , is no mean feat . looking back into ` deep time ' it becomes more difficult to put a date on early earth events . in part , this is because there is little ` classical geology ' dating from the time of the formation of the earth , such as an absence of rock layers from that era . so geochemists rely on other methods to estimate early earth events . one of the standard techniques is measuring the changes in the proportions of different gases -lrb- isotopes -rrb- which survive from the early earth - but even this only gives an estimate . ` it 's not possible to give an exact date for the formation of the earth , ' said dr guillaume avice of the university of lorraine . ` the oldest rocks of the solar system have been dated to 4,568 million years ago - so earth is younger than that . ` what this work does is show earth is older than we thought - by around 60 million years . ' the new findings were made by studying xenon gas that had been trapped in quartz crystals -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- in south africa and australia . the findings showed that the giant imapct that is thought to have created the moon must have happened about 60 million years earlier , meaning earth is also similarly older . the study resets the clock for the . collision between earth 's ancestor and a planet-sized object that led to . the formation of the moon . the scientists analysed xenon gas found in quartz from south africa and australia which had been dated to 3.4 and 2.7 billion years respectively . the gas sealed in this mineral is preserved like a time capsule - allowing comparisons of the current isotopic ratios of xenon with those that existed billions of years ago . recalibrating dating techniques using the ancient gas allowed them to refine the estimate of when earth began to form . this allowed them to calculate the moon-forming impact is around 60 million years older than had been thought - give or take 20 million years . earth and the moon are pictured here by the galileo spacecraft on 16 december 1992 . after the planet was struck by a mars-sized object , debris surrounded earth and eventually became the moon , which is tidally locked to our planet , meaning the same face always points our way . ` the composition of the gases we are looking at changes according to the conditions they are found in - which of course depend on the major events in earth 's history , ' continued dr avice . ` the gas sealed in these quartz samples has been handed down to us in a sort of time capsule . ` we are using standard methods to compute the age of earth but having access to these ancient samples gives us new data and allows us to refine the measurement . ` the xenon gas signals allow us to calculate when the atmosphere was being formed , which was probably at the time earth collided with a planet-sized body leading to the formation of the moon . ` our results mean that both earth and the moon are older than we had thought . ' previously the time of formation of the earth 's atmosphere had been estimated at around 100 million years after the solar system formation . as the atmosphere would not have survived the moon-forming impact this revision puts the age up to 40 million years after the solar sytem formation - so around 60 million years older than previously thought . co-researcher dr bernard marty said : ` this might seem a small difference - but it 's important . ` these differences set time boundaries on how the planets evolved - especially through the major collisions in deep time which shaped the solar system . '	 researchers in france have revealed what they claim to be earth 's new age .   findings are based on analysis of ancient gas in south africa and australia .   study suggests the giant impact that formed the moon happened earlier than first thought .   it had been thought earth formed 100 million years after the solar system .   but now it is believed our planet formed just 40 million years after . 
416	do n't blame hannibal lecter - he ca n't help being a callous , murdering monster . new research suggests psychopaths lack basic hard-wiring in the brain that enables most people to be compassionate and caring , scientists say . they say mri scans revealed distinct differences in the way highly-psychopathic individuals ' and ordinary people 's brains reacted when they were shown footage of people being intentionally hurt . no empathy : psychopaths like sir anthony hopkins ' hannibal lecter character lack basic hardwiring in the brain that enables humans to feel compassion , scientists say . scientists at the university of chicago studied 80 male prisoners aged between 18 and 50 who were assessed for psychopathic traits . around 20 to 30 per cent of the u.s. prison population is believed to be affected by psychopathy - compared with one per cent of the general population . study participants underwent brain scans while being shown videos of people being intentionally hurt and others of faces reacting to pain . their findings , published today , may help to shed light on why criminal psychopaths like cannibal lecter , played by sir anthony hopkins , appear void of remorse or compassion . empathy : scientists observed reduced activity in key areas of the brain when psychopathic individuals were shown videos of people being hurt . psychopaths displayed significantly less activity in key areas of the brain including the amygdala - an almond-shaped bundle of neurons which plays an important role in processing emotions like fear , anger and pleasure . the stunted response observed . in the amygdala and in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was consistent with . previous studies of psychopathy , researchers said . converseley , more activity was seen in the striatum and insula regions . the high activity recorded in the insula region surprised the scientists , as the area is central to emotion . ' a marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy , ' said lead researcher professor jean decety . ` this is the first time that neural processes associated with empathic processing have been directly examined in individuals with psychopathy , especially in response to the perception of other people in pain or distress . ' psychopaths are known to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of repetitive crime and violence . the university of chicago study , published in the journal jama psychiatry , said : ` the neural response to distress of others such as pain is thought to reflect an aversive response in the observer that may act as a trigger to inhibit aggression or prompt motivation to help . ` hence , examining the neural response of individuals with psychopathy as they view others being harmed or expressing pain is an effective probe into the neural processes underlying affective and empathy deficits in psychopathy . '	 psychopathy affects around 20 to 30 % of u.s. prison population .   this compares with just 1 % of the general u.s. population .   prisoners shown video footage of people being intentionally hurt .   mri scans revealed distinct differences in brains ' responses . 
417	it 's a touching tribute that was put together by a complete stranger . but a video that collates the final tweets of a girl purportedly dying of terminal brain cancer - posting on her social media site right up until her death - has been the cause of plenty tears this weekend . while there remains some debate over the authenticity of the tweets and the possibility the account is a hoax , the ever-increasing amount of viewers do n't seem to care based on the message the clip is leaving with people . there is no last name attached to the twitter handle of ` amanda ' -lrb- @trappedatmydesk -rrb- , which chronicles the musings of a young woman who moves to ottawa , canada , works for the government , discovers she 's sick and then dies from her illness . however the four-minute video - which brings together a snapshot of amanda 's final five months - is showing people how short life is and what we might take for granted . touching : twitter user ` amanda ' -lrb- left -rrb- documented the last few months of her life on her social media site after discovering she had a brain tumor . blogger and mom shannon mckarney -lrb- right -rrb- gathered all the tweets together and made a video of them as a tribute to amanda 's life and a reminder of our own . see video here . and , with many noticing that amanda 's death is dated april 2013 , it 's a stark reminder of the need to pay more attention to those around us , because these haunting posts are only really being noticed now . ` that 's the main thing that struck me , ' said the creator of the video , blogger and stay-at-home mom shannon mckarney stated in her blog zchamu.com . ' i never met her , but her story stayed with me . ' i kept going back and reading her tweet stream , wishing i had reached out when she was alive . ` but i missed the chance . she was gone . ' the video was initially made for a presentation for a digital strategy conference but , after recently posting it online , mckarney realized how quickly it was resonating with people . however mckarney 's attempts to verify amanda 's story have so far been unsuccessful , despite her attempts to reach out to family members and friends using her video , blog and social . ` you ca n't verify anything online , but i chose to take it at face value because there 's nothing else to be done , ' mckarney said . the beginning : the tone of ` amanda 's # twitter feed began to change in early january when she started worrying about a forthcoming doctors appointment . this is the moment amanda finds out she has advanced glioblastoma multiforme - a brain tumor . amanda discusses quitting her job with only a few months to live . ` it is a moving story . ... i believe that she was an individual , and i believe that her life mattered . ' mckarney also said the story said alot about social media and the world we live in . ` it used to be that you would just find batches of letters in somebody 's attic , and you would read their history that way , ' she said . ` now we leave these digital traces behind us everywhere we go -- tweets and facebook posts and blog posts -- and it really stayed with me that some day that may be the only way that people can get to know you and the person that you were . ' the @trappedatmydesk account produced almost 170 tweets , and states that amanda was in ottawa , according to the ottawa citzen . the feed was launched in november 2009 , with : ` figuring out twitter . how do i find more people in ottawa ? ' however early last year , everything changed . ` my doctors office just called me to come in to discuss some test results . that can only be bad , right ? the -lrb- sic -rrb- do n't call unless its -lrb- sic -rrb- bad news , ' the writer stated on january 14 , 2013 . after finishing up her job , amanda said she went on a trip , but had to return she when started to get sick . final three : these are the official last tweets on amanda 's twitter account . by january 18 , the writer referred to test results : ` advanced glioblastoma multiforme . ' -lrb- brain tumor -rrb- . the next the account statedl ` deciding what to do for the rest of my life . ' then on january 21 : ' i just resigned from my #goc -lrb- government of canada -rrb- job . no point when i have 3mths to live , right ? i wonder if i 'll get my pension money . ' there were no tweets for a couple of months , until the writer stated in march that she 'd gone travelling and returned home after she started to get sick . on april 10 , the writer stated : ` do n't spend time being angry at people . forgive them . life is entirely too short . ' the last post came that day : ` tomorrow , i go back into the hospital for the last time . thank you all for the good vibes . be good to each other . #quietlastnight ' the next and final tweet from the account was apparently written by someone named james on april 15 . ` my dear little sister amanda passed away from brain cancer late last night , ' it says . heartbreaking : someone purporting to be amanda 's brother , named james , announces that she has died .	 twitter user known only as ` amanda ' revealed on her account in january 2013 she had a brain tumor and would soon die .   the account stated her death occurred three months later in april .   during that time amanda continued to tweet her thoughts while aware of her fate in short but heartfelt posts .   now blogger shannon mckarney - who did n't know amanda - has found and pieced together the tweets alongside music for a youtube video that is touching people all over the world . 
418	he wants his just desserts : alex snelson is suing because his diet dows not allow him to eat processed foods he is being forced to eat , but does allow ice cream . a satanic inmate has filed a federal lawsuit accusing his nevada jailers of violating his constitutional rights by denying him meals adhering to his strict pagan diet . alex c. snelson , 33 , argues in the lawsuit that denying him meals without byproducts and processing additives force him to either starve or go against his religion . he lists ice cream as being one of those foods . snelson made the accusations in a hand-written complaint filed to the u.s. district court in reno , and insisted ice cream is one of the ` whole foods ' his religion permits him to eat . he claims deputies retaliated against him by refusing him ice cream because they said it would violate his religion . ` each day that i am effectively forced to eat outside my religious dietary guidelines is a day that i must endure feeling totally and utterly violated , tortured and religiously defiled , ' snelson wrote . the devil horn tattooed criminal was homeless and unemployed when he was arrested in 2013 . he is serving two to six years in state . prison for possession of a stolen car after spending time in the washoe . county jail in reno for possession of methamphetamine and brass . knuckles . he said the violation of his first amendment rights caused him to suffer at the county jail . he 's seeking ` hedonic ' and ` vindictive ' damages as well as monetary and punitive damages . county prosecutors said friday they had n't seen the new filing and had no comment . county spokesman bob harmon said it is the policy of the jail operated by the sheriff 's office to ` accommodate the religious practices of all inmates . ' mr. snelson 's allegations are just that -- allegations , and we are confident that the facts will show that the washoe county sheriff 's office acted in accordance with constitutional requirements , # harmon said friday . the filing : the lawsuit was filed with a handwritten compliant explaining how snelson feels his rights have been violated . washoe county deputy district attorney mary kandaras said in court filings in march that the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals has held previously that such claims must be ` rooted in religious belief ' not in ` purely secular ' philosophical concerns . ` determining if a prisoner 's claim is ` rooted in religious belief ' requires analyzing whether the prisoner 's claim is related to his sincerely held religion 's belief , ' she said in a motion requesting that snelson be required to explain his beliefs . kandaras said snelson 's original lawsuit filed in august did n't identify any specific religion , the content of his diet , whether his diet was recognized by the tenets of his religion or if he simply made it up . snelson , who is acting as his own attorney , said in the amended suit he is a full , active and participating member of the pagan religion satanism . ' i use my diet to purify and cleanse my internal organs , ' he said , adding that the ` religious dietary restrictions that have been imposed on me by my church and by my religion and by my faith . ' where it happened : the nevada state prison , outside reno , is where snelson is being held . snelson said he is a member of the church of light in chino hills , california . there is no readily available record of such a church existing . a leader of a leading international satanic organization also questioned snelson 's claims . the church of satan , founded in san francisco in 1966 by anton szandor lavey , allows its members ` to choose whatever diet is pleasing to them , ' said magus peter h. gilmore , a high priest at the church . the church website says it is the ` original church of satan ' dedicated to the ` acceptance of man 's nature as an animal living in a cosmos that is indifferent to his existence . ' it adds that satanism is ` not devil worship . there is no belief in god , satan , the soul , the supernatural or in any form of afterlife . ' devotees are permitted to enjoy ice cream .	 alex snelson claims he can eat only ` whole foods ' without byproducts or processing additives .   he listed ice cream as one of those foods on a handwritten legal complaint .

421	dozing in a mother 's lap , eyes half-closed , or throwing their arms around a father 's shoulders in a great hug -- every child craves a parent 's affection . for sirga the lioness , it is no different . though , in this case , her parent is a human . conservationist valentin gruener , 27 , co‑founder of the modisa wildlife project in the kalahari , botswana , has his hands full with the three-year-old lioness he has raised almost from birth . now a teenager in lion years , sirga is preparing to live in the wild -- and surrogate parent valentin is teaching her to hunt . scroll down for video . friends for life : the story of the abandoned lion cub sirga who was raised by a german wildlife enthusiast in his 20s was one of the most shared stories on social media last year . sirga was found close to death on a farm , in february 2012 , after a litter of three cubs was born to a pride of lions . two of the babies died and the third was abandoned by the adults . working with a vet , valentin put the tiny animal , weighing just 4lb , on a drip to combat severe dehydration . over the next few days , he experimented with a recipe to fatten her up , until he hit upon a mixture of fresh eggs , cream , milk , vitamins , sunflower oil and calcium . ` to this day we believe she is probably the most spoiled and well-fed lion in botswana , ' he laughs . within a year , she had put on 175lb , was weaned and was eating raw meat . valentin , born in germany , and his fellow conservationist , mikkel legarth from denmark , were determined to help sirga return to the wild , and have been coaching her to hunt . that meant hours spent teaching her to stalk and kill -- skills which are not wholly instinctive and which cubs typically learn from the adults in their pride . ` we did n't want sirga to become like other lions in captivity , constantly fed by streams of tourists , ' says mikkel . ` she hunts her own food , taking antelopes , and she will let us be near her when she eats it , which is remarkable . ` we want to release her eventually as a wild lion , not as one who has met lots of people . that would be dangerous . she only interacts with me and valentin . ' best buds : conservationist valentin gruener , 27 , raised sirga after she was abandoned by her pride . new challenge : a documentary series follows sirga and mr gruener as he teaches her how to hunt . realising that they were developing a unique bond with sirga , the two naturalists invited filmmaker jurgen jozefowicz in , and a six part series called lionheart will be released later this year . the film shows how sirga nuzzles and even hugs her human ` parents ' , and will allow them to scratch her tummy or rub her jaws . she keeps her claws sheathed during play sessions and lies with her head contentedly on valentin 's lap while he strokes her ears . most of us can only imagine the thrill of raising a lion from a cub . but john partridge , senior curator of animals at bristol zoo gardens , and his team have shared a similar experience over the past two years . as sirga does not have a pride to teach her how to hunt , mr gruener has to get down and dirty and show her . in order to teach her how to live as a wild lion , mr gruener has spent many hours crouching in scrubland or pouncing in watering holes alongside sirga . success ? a proud sirga managed to catch a large swollen toad , and carried it in her mouth . the zoo 's pair of endangered asiatic lions had twin cubs , called kamran and ketan , in november 2012 . but the mother rejected them when they were just 13 days old after her mate died . ` we do n't carry out hand-rearing unless there 's a strong reason , ' emphasises john . ` if the babies have been with their mother for a while , it is quite a challenge to get them used to artificial milk and teats , as they are obviously used to suckling naturally . ' lions reared by humans will treat them as part of their pride , he says . many readers will remember the story of john rendall , who bought a lion cub in the pet department at harrods in 1969 with his friend anthony bourke , and raised it in his flat above a shop on the fashionable king 's road in london . as one : mr gruener is fulfilling a lifelong ambition by living with lions in the wilds of africa . family : mr gruener observes as a veterinarian cares for his beloved lioness friend . the new documentary has been called an ` extraordinary story that transcends all known borders between man and lion , predator and prey ' by its makers . sustainable living : a team from the modisa wildlife project feed a group of young male lions in an enclosure . when the cub , who they called christian , outgrew the flat , they arranged , with the help of conservations , to introduce him to the wild in kenya . when john and anthony returned to kenya a year later , christian recognised them instantly , putting his paws on their shoulders in rapturous excitement . the footage subsequently became an internet sensation when it was posted on youtube in 2008 . it has since been watched more than 100 million times . perhaps the extraordinary bond between sirga and her surrogate parents valentin and mikkel will prove as touchingly enduring .	 video of lion hugging her conservationist carer went viral last year .   lioness sirga was saved as a cub by 27-year-old valentin gruener .   new documentary follows pair as mr gruener teaches sirga to hunt .

439	in my job as a comedienne/impressionist i was lucky enough to land a job on a leg of p&o cruises ' aurora world cruise - and brought the family along . the segment of the cruise we enjoyed was the five-day leg from singapore to sri lanka . i am glad to say that my on-board guest entertainment act seemed to go down well - though quite what the non-british passengers made of my takes on the likes of stacey solomon , davina mccall and anne robinson i 'm not too sure . but i , at least , really enjoyed it . and here 's me during a quick day off : debra and their children hit the beach on malaysia 's langkawi shoreline . the job presented me with the opportunity to bring my husband and our two children , aged 11 and seven , along on a voyage in a very beautiful part of the world . my children were also able to see my act - so that they could finally understand what i do for a living . we liked the fact that the cruise was very british : the voyage 's itinerary begins and ends in southampton , so the majority of passengers were from the uk - and on-board activities were run largely to satisfy british tastes . my initial pleasure at being on a cruise ship was the realisation that i was to be relieved of my usual domestic chores : it was very nice , for example , to take a break from vacuuming ! islands of inspiration : malaysia 's langkawi archipelago has some of the far east 's loveliest beaches . we stopped twice on our short trip , firstly in port klang , which serves malaysia 's capital kuala lumpur . the following day we got to see a little bit of the beautiful archipelago of langkawi . the day we stopped there was my husband 's birthday , so we decided to enjoy it on the beach . what i love about cruising is the fact that you get a taster of these different places . ever wondered what malaysia is like ? on a cruise you can find out in a few hours . another surprise for first-time cruisers is that the ship is a selfcontained world of its own , with everything you could possibly want to enjoy the perfect holiday . the food on board , for instance , is a key attraction . dining in the restaurant was a pleasure , not just because of the cuisine but also because of the staff : the waiters were just lovely . our kids loved one of them so much they actually said : ` can we keep in touch with him ? ' one of the things you often hear is that people put on half a stone during a cruise . not me : i actually lost 6lb in a week . i know that sounds ridiculous and it sounds as if i did n't like the dishes served , but i really did . i found that there was so much choice and i naturally gravitated towards the healthier options . where , at home , i can be a bit lazy and just grab a calorific sandwich , on board the aurora i was able to enjoy healthy salads and fruits . a big boat for a brilliant family holiday : debra sailed on the p&o cruises liner aurora . the kids also ate well because , again , there was a lot of choice for them , and because it was all so beautifully presented they were willing to try things they had never eaten before . it helped that they spent most of their days in the pool and were very hungry when meal times came around . we had a few days in sri lanka at the end of the tour and joined some great excursions . we really enjoyed our visit to pinnawala elephant orphanage , for example . i would love to go back to singapore , our ` taster ' visit really made us want to return . there was an excursion to the zoo which we did n't get to do , and we would have loved to visit the street markets too . cruising is like the best showbusiness act - it leaves you wanting more ! like my act , hopefully ... p&o cruises -lrb- www.pocruises.com ; 0843 374 0111 -rrb- offers fly-cruises in south east asia and the middle east . prices start at # 2,039 , with # 40 per person on-board spend , for an 11-night adult-only cruise on arcadia departing march 25 with full board and entertainment . return flights and transfers cost from # 890 per person .	 debra stephenson was an impressionist on a recent p&o cruises voyage .   the posting meant a chance to take her children to a few exotic locations .   sunshine hotspots including malaysia and sri lanka were ports of call . 
440	one night last november , when we arrived home from school , mummy and daddy told us that they had heard strange sounds from the area behind our garage . we put on our wellies and ran excitedly across the grass , past the chickens and the pond , to the back of the garden where daddy parks his car . balancing on top of the builders ' rubble and our old bikes was a pile of sparkly boxes . he 's the genuine article : scott and megan met the real santa claus at his snowy home at the top of the planet . there was a small one labelled ` megan ' , a slightly bigger one labelled ` scott ' , a bigger one still labelled ` mummy ' , and the biggest one of all labelled ` daddy ' . we tore off the silver ribbon and bows and opened the boxes . each one contained a jumper with a picture on it . megan and daddy had a snowman , scott had a father christmas and mummy had a sparkly penguin . in ours we also had a rolled up sheet of thick paper , tied with a red bow . daddy unrolled it and read what it said . written in swirly hand writing , like we 'd seen in old books , it said : . dear megan and scott . i hear from my robins that you have been very good this year . i 'd like you to come and meet me at the north pole . your mummy and daddy can come too . it 's very cold , so i have asked my elves to send you some new jumpers to keep you warm . see you soon ! lots of love , santa x . for a moment we did n't quite understand . then mummy and daddy explained . we had been written to by the real santa claus , and he 'd posted us the boxes and the letter from his home at the north pole . we 've both seen all the helpers who look like santa that appear around town at christmas . but this was the real santa , really inviting us to visit him in his real home at the real north pole . and he 'd sent us new jumpers to keep us warm . we could n't believe how lucky we were . thank goodness we 'd been good ! a few weeks later mummy and daddy drove us to the airport in bristol . santa had sent a special plane to collect us and some other lucky children . we were worried it would take a very long time , but by the time we 'd watched a film and done some colouring we were there . when we arrived at the airport at the north pole we had to collect our suitcases , but before they arrived we spotted two elves with pointy ears who had been hiding under the place where the bags go round . jumpers required for big adventures : scott and megan with mum kirsty and tv presenter dad martin roberts . they were very naughty elves , because they kept tapping people on the back and then running away . it made us laugh a lot . all around the airport it was snowy . there was a man dressed in funny clothes that mummy said everyone would have worn here years ago . he had a pet reindeer . we gave it a carrot . it looked a bit like sven from frozen . in fact , everything looked frozen . we got on a coach that took us to the place we were staying . on the way , some different elves made us sing silly songs . after half an hour mummy and daddy said the songs were driving them mad . but we carried on singing . our hotel was made from wood . the room was really big and had a tv . there was a kitchen where mummy could cook our tea . the best thing was that the room had a balcony that was covered in snow that came up to our tummies . there were lots of other wooden hotels all around , and a place we went to for our breakfast . there was even a supermarket . we did n't think they would have a supermarket at the north pole - especially one that sold dvds . that night we went for a ride on special machines that could go through the snow . they were like the ones from scott 's star wars lego . daddy drove one , and we snuggled under a blanket in another with mummy . we went through the car park and out into the forest . eventually we arrived at a place where there was a bonfire and a man who gave us hot chocolate with marshmallows in it . the grown-ups said we had come to see the northern lights , but someone had switched them off . the next day we got on another coach and went to a secret place in the forest . there were loads of fun things to do , like sledging , rides on a sleigh pulled by real reindeer , and a funny show starring the elves . but then we got into a special sledge that was pulled by an elf on a sort of motorbike for the snow . a bit different to a sleigh ride : a snowmobile ride in search of the northern lights was also part of the holiday . we went down a path through the trees to a clearing where there was a little wooden house . inside the house , sitting beside a roaring fire , was the real santa claus . he looked the same as lots of other santa clauses we 'd seen , but his tummy was even bigger and his beard even longer and whiter than anyone else 's . somehow he knew our names , and he asked us what we wanted him to bring us on christmas night . he said we could take a picture and gave us an early christmas present . on the way home we heard mummy and daddy say that it had cost a lot , and that the food ` left a bit to be desired ' . we did n't understand what they meant . santa had invited us to come for free . and as for the food - it was better than eating snow , and the hotel was at the north pole , so the person cooking would have to find things to cook in the forest . and anyway , on christmas day we got exactly what we had asked santa for , so it was worth it . i hope we get invited again this year , although santa did say that there were a lot of children in the world that he wanted to invite , so it 's ok if we do n't as we 've already had our turn . and if any silly boys or girls at school say ` there 's no such thing as santa claus ' , we will know they are fibbing , because we have met him . santa 's lapland -lrb- www.santaslapland.com , 01483 791945 -rrb- offers a range of holidays to lapland . a three-day trip to the finnish village of saariselka costs from # 499 per person , including return flights , transfers , half-board accommodation , private family meeting with santa and gifts for under-13s , and a full day 's activities .	 scott and megan roberts , aged 6 and 4 , were ` invited ' to visit santa claus .   they visited father christmas at his home at the north pole -lrb- well , lapland -rrb- .   garish christmas jumpers were required -lrb- well , it can be chilly that far north -rrb- .

' cried zubair , encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter , aged ten . down and dirty in the dust : oman is a great place to try the very modern motorised pastime of dune-bashing . oman 's wahiba sands are classic desert terrain - the sort you get in a david lean film or one of those ` parched man crawls towards oasis ' newspaper cartoons . hillocks of sand stretched to the horizon . what was most striking was the colours , at once uniform and subtly different . the sand was all yellow , of course , but there were valleys of brown and black , too , lengthening as the golden sun dropped . zubair drove with gusto . we surged over and through the dunes . it was like skiing . ` snowplough ! ' i yelled when we seemed to be going down an incline far too steeply - and the car , thrillingly , was skidding sideways , throwing out a high spray of sand . where desert meets water : the omani capital muscat has a picturesque charm and an undiscovered vibe . our children cackled with laughter . zubair grinned broadly . my wife screamed . the moment we stepped out of the 4x4 , there came a contrast : complete , refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape . this was the reason i 'd dug deep into the family savings and chosen oman for a week 's holiday over new year . it lived up to every expectation . the sultanate of oman , long an ally of britain , lies east of saudi arabia . to its south is troubled yemen . british airways flights from heathrow take seven hours to reach the omani capital muscat . for the first four days , we had the company of speed-merchant zubair . he took us to the fortified town of nizwa , where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on fridays . the nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging western tourists -- when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews , she was charged the omani rial equivalent of # 3 . ` you should have haggled , ' i said . she told me she would have felt mean . ` they expect and enjoy haggling , ' insisted zubair . nizwa has a restored fort that could have been the setting for carry on up the khyber . i was half expecting to find kenneth williams round the next turret . a solid day 's work : fishing is still an important part of life in the waterfront muttrah district of muscat . even better than nizwa 's fort was the one at jabrin , where a 17th-century sultan reclined with dates , concubines and political worries . his reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors . and his fortifications had gizmos worthy of james bond : false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths , and ` killing holes ' through which boiling-hot date syrup could be poured . the beautiful sun and moon room , meanwhile , was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver-lit by night . arid oman 's mountains are a purpling grey , and water is precious . where the irrigation projects have not yet reached , you see blue water lorries labouring up roads . government infrastructure work is everywhere . since 1970 , the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century , yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest . although western tourists are welcomed , women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets -lrb- no short skirts , low-cut tops or bare shoulders -rrb- . pleased to meet you : though a different prospect to dubai , oman is a place that offers a warm welcome . nor would you ever go to oman for a western stag night - alcohol is not plentiful . we spent a night on the country 's tallest mountain , 9,800 ft jebel shams , which has a not-so-mini ` grand canyon ' . our accommodation at the view camp was odd - freezing-cold , prefab huts with mod-con bathrooms worthy of a london hotel . but true to its name , it had a fine view of the plain below . the nearby village of misfat was a delight , an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms . my wife was so enchanted by one deep-gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home . in the desert , we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were bedouin-style tents , and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies . for supper , the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours . gosh , it was cold that night . but our children found it all fascinating - and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of arabic . meeting the local wildlife : it is almost impossible to travel through oman without spotting a camel or two . the least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards muscat and had a few nights at the opulent -lrb- but pricey -rrb- al waha hotel . great pools , comfortable rooms , but we could have been in western europe , complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends . we did manage to escape into the city , however , and visit the souk , with its goodly whiff of frankincense , the fish market -lrb- rather different smells there -rrb- and the grand mosque , which was completed in 2001 . the chandelier in the mosque 's main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs - just think of the electricity bills ! the mosque complex , which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers , is a monument to cultural and national self-confidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering arabian mystique . abercrombie & kent -lrb- 01242 854 133 , www.abercrombiekent.co.uk -rrb- offers eight nights in oman from # 1,675 per adult , based on two sharing . children under 12 are an additional # 1,025 pp based on two sharing , including return flights with british airways .	 dubai 's next-door neighbour has plenty to offer as a holiday destination .   dune-bashing - driving on huge piles of sand in a 4wd - is a key attraction .   muscat , the omani capital , is an intriguing city of history , culture and luxury .

'' i 'm leaning towards there 's a penalty toward it . ' he failed to mention that a disease-free man having sex with another disease-free man - or a disease-free woman having sex with another disease-free woman - would produce the same results . robertson also did not touch upon his own previous conduct , which did not keep sexual relations between one man and one woman when he reportedly cheated on his wife , kay . they are just the latest controversial comments from robertson , who has unapologetically maintained his anti-gay stance , despite briefly being removed from duck dynasty last year . fan favorite : robertson , right , and his family make up the cast of duck dynasty . a&e briefly removed him from the show at the end of last year after he made anti-gay remarks during an interview with gq magazine . on being moral : robertson is pictured with his wife kay , who previously said her husband cheated on her . in an interview with gq last december , the millionaire duck hunter launched into his first attack . ` everything is blurred on what 's right and what 's wrong . sin becomes fine , ' he said in an interview with gq last year . ` start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there . being heard : he made the comments during a book tour for his new book , unphiltered . ` bestiality , sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men ... neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers - they wo n't inherit the kingdom of god . ` instead of acknowledging their sin , they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins . do n't deceive yourselves ' he also grouped homosexuals with terrorists , saying , ` we never , ever judge someone on who 's going to heaven , hell . that 's the almighty 's job . we just love 'em , give 'em the good news about jesus - whether they 're homosexuals , drunks , terrorists . we let god sort 'em out later , you see what i 'm saying ?

448	in the futuristic 1987 film robocop it was depicted as a crime-ridden city left in ruins after years of financial decline . the film 's writer ed neumeirer scribbled ` the future left detroit behind ' on the first page of the script to sum up the city where the story is set . little did he know , his prophetic note would become an apt description of modern-day detroit after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in american history with debts of around $ 18 billion earlier this month . scroll down for video . on the brink : the 1987 film robocop , pictured , written by ed neumeirer is set in a futuristic crime-ridden detroit on the verge of financial collapse . modern-day detroit : graffiti decorates the ruins of the packard automotive plant - a 35 acre site where luxury cars were manufactured until the 1950s . mr neumeier says robocop , the story of a terminally-wounded officer who returns to the force as a powerful cyborg to police the city 's crime-ridden streets , is a metaphor showing the ` industrial decline in america ' . he insisted on detroit being the setting for the film as it has always been very dependent on a single industry - car manufacturing which led to the city being dubbed ` motor city ' or ` motown ' because of this . but the decline of the industry in the 1980s , when japan emerged as new rival in the automotive world , started to have a major impact on the city 's prosperity . mr neumeier told cnn : ` the reason . detroit is important is because it 's facing an economic blight that you . can imagine happening in a lot of places . decline : buildings in what was once detroit 's prime business district sit largely abandoned after the city 's population shrunk to 700,000 . the abandoned fisher body plant in detroit - the cradle of the automobile assembly line and a symbol of industrial might - after the city filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in american history after decades of decline . ` in retrospect , the idea of `` robocop '' really goes back to the car industry . the sculpture of it is very much . detroit road-iron . having grown up in the sixties when the muscle car . was so prominent , the notion of cars was very important to me then and . ultimately to the formation of robocop . ' looking to the future : writer ed neumeier wrote ` the future left detroit behind ' on the first page of the robocop script - which proved to be an accurate prediction of what would happen to the city . the u.s. government bailed out the automotive industry to the tune of $ 80 billion between 2008 and 2010 but that has done little to stop the financial decline in detroit . it has an unemployment rate of 16 per cent of its 700,000 population as the number of jobs in the automotive industry continue to decline . detroit was also been named the most dangerous city in america in 2012 by forbes magazine and the most miserable in 2013 . those living in the city face major cuts to public services under debt restructuring proposals . the city 's current plight shares striking similarities with the future detroit portrayed in robocop . in the film , detroit is reliant upon a multinational corporation , called omni consumer products -lrb- ocp -rrb- , which runs everything from hospitals to its police force . mr neumeier believes that private companies are playing an ever increasing role in all areas of our lives - just like in robocop . he said : ` we are now living in the world that i was proposing in robocop . we are increasingly asking corporations to do these things for us ... to provide human services . but their objectives are different to public service needs .

458	i was at old trafford on saturday to see manchester united comfortably beat leicester city 3-1 and one of the standout players was luke shaw . it occurred to me that this guy has every chance of going on to be a manchester united legend over the next 15 to 20 years . but could he end up being united 's best ever left back , overtaking denis irwin , much loved by united die-hards , much underrated outside of the club ? that 's a tough ask given the amount of success irwin enjoyed - he remains united 's second most decorated player behind ryan giggs . he was a rare breed , as sound defensively as he was going forward , and i see both those qualities in shaw . luke shaw was one for manchester united 's best players in their 3-1 victory against leicester city . the england international was full of running on saturday ... now he needs a long-term run of fitness . denis irwin is united 's greatest left back , pictured here celebrating a goal against middlesbrough in 1999 . it 's hard to believe he is still only a teenager . but at just 19 he has the time to play more games than the 529 irwin appeared in , and even more than the 602 made by another celebrated united full back , gary neville . there are just two things missing from shaw 's game right now , and one of them -- a long-term consistent run of fitness -- could hold him back for club and country . shaw heard louis van gaal 's public criticism of his fitness levels earlier in the season and admitted the united manager was right . on saturday shaw played the full 90 minutes , and gave an energetic display up and down the left flank no problem . he seems to have learned his lesson , after declaring he needed to achieve a far greater level of fitness at united than he had at southampton . but he has picked up a few niggling injuries this season , keeping him out of action on three occasions . it could just be bad luck of course , but he 'll be keen to cut those spells on the sidelines down . shaw , pictured in action in manchester united 's fa cup draw at cambridge in january . irwin pictured celebrating with gary neville after united beat barcelona in the 1999 champions league final . irwin played more than 500 games for united , and was a favourite among the club 's supporters . physically he 's on the way to being a beast , and his ability is obvious . some have questioned his defensive strength -- he makes mistakes like all defenders , but not a significantly high number of errors , his tackling generally looks effective , and his reading of opponents seems sound . the other area lacking in his game is goals . in 79 first-team appearances with southampton and united , he has yet to register a goal , and from what i 've seen he 's not even looked like scoring . goals are not shaw 's priority of course , and he should n't be judged as a good or bad player based on the amount of goals he scores . but irwin weighed in with a few , endearing him still more to the old trafford faithful . i like shaw a lot , and i suspect united fans already realise they have a quality player on their hands . if he applies himself , and stays fit , he 's set to be united 's left back -- and probably england 's left back -- for many years to come . it 's not easy becoming a manchester united legend , but shaw has that opportunity right in front of him .	 luke shaw was one of man united 's standout players against leicester .   he has every chance of going on to be legend for the old trafford club .   could he end up being united 's best left back and overtaking denis irwin ?   goals are not shaw 's priority but irwin weighed in with a few at united .   click here for all the latest manchester united news . 
459	arsenal must win the champions league this season , or their star man will surely want out . who knows what is going on in alexis sanchez 's mind but just put yourself in his boots for a second : what do you think is going on in his head when he takes a look at the premier league table ? during his little injury break i suspect he will be wondering whether he should be playing at a bigger club , a club capable of a genuine title challenge . alexis sanchez , pictured in action against brighton , may be wondering whether his future is at arsenal . the chile international has shined for the gunners so far this term , but the club are still outside the top four . he 's had the season of his life so far -- he 's been shining virtually every week for arsenal . yet when he looks at the table he sees that his team is not even in the top four . how will sanchez feel , having played so well , worked so hard , shown world-class quality , to see that those efforts have only managed to take arsenal to fifth in the table ? in the same way nobody really knows what was going on in diego costa 's mind last tuesday when he was putting his stamp on that capital one cup tie , i ca n't be sure what is going on in sanchez 's head . but i 'm guessing he will be feeling exasperated and frustrated , asking himself what he has to do to get this side challenging for the title . sanchez , pictured grabbing hold of team-mate mesut ozil , missed the 5-0 victory over aston villa on sunday . will sanchez be happy staying on the arsene wenger train where the destination is mediocrity central ? do n't get me wrong - i 'm certain arsenal will finish in the top four . and they 're still in the champions league where a kind draw could take them all the way to a final where anything can happen over 90 or 120 minutes . but if arsenal do n't win the champions league where will that leave sanchez ? will he be happy staying on the arsene wenger train -- destination mediocrity central , calling at low expectations junction and fourth place trophyville ? he 's bigger than that of course . he 's enjoying his football at arsenal , some might argue . just like he 'd enjoy his football at a club that wins big trophies . others will wonder how i can write this stuff after the gunners have just won 5-0 . it was against aston villa -- it 's standard behaviour for arsenal to batter weak teams more often than not . chuba akpom wins a penalty for arsenal after he is fouled by aston villa goalkeeper brad guzan . per mertesacker congratulates hector bellerin after the arsenal youngster scored his side 's fifth goal . theo walcott was also on target in the win for arsenal against a poor aston villa side at the emirates stadium . from the sidelines or sat in his living room sanchez would have heard the ` oles ' of the arsenal fans when their team was strolling to victory on sunday . he might think it 's brilliant from the fans ; or he might realise he 's at a club where standards and expectations are so low those fans are satisfied with a bit of keep ball when a terrible team comes to the emirates . quite what he made of the last 20 minutes of the game turning into a testimonial with everyone desperately passing to young chuba akpom hoping for him to score a goal is anyone 's guess . it 's all very sweet and nice from arsenal to look after a young player , but a bigger win was easily achievable , and would have landed the gunners in the top four . that would have been a huge statement . the elite challenge themselves -- they do n't settle for fourth-best , it 's not in their mentality . that 's why thierry henry left in the end . sanchez has an opportunity to do something this season not even henry did for arsenal -- lead the gunners ' charge to champions league success . if they do n't achieve that glory , are all arsenal fans confident their star man will want to stay ? and if arsenal do achieve european glory this season , will all 11 players get statues outside the emirates ? i do hope so .	 surely alexis sanchez will want out if arsenal do not triumph in europe ?   he has been the club 's star man , but gunners are not even in the top four .   arsenal should have beaten aston villa by a bigger margin ... but players were happy to turn the premier league clash into a testimonial .   sanchez would have heard the ` oles ' from the arsenal faithful at the end ... are expectations so low , they 're happy with keep-ball against a poor side ? 
460	i 've always been supportive of referees . of course you call the errors , but generally speaking i like to think i have an appreciation of the difficulty of the job referees do and that is reflected in my assessment of their performance . i do feel managers use referees as a way of deflecting blame away from themselves and their players and that a lot of players and bosses need to look in the mirror before looking at the referee . but this season , officials are making it more and more difficult for those of us who defend them from inevitable criticism . some of the errors made have been astonishingly bad , and have left me wondering two things : do they actually know the laws of the game ? and secondly , are they actually watching the game properly ? jose fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee bobby madley having a clear view . newcastle 's emmanuel riviere protested to referee madley , who waved his appeals away immediately . despite riviere 's impassioned appeals to the official , newcastle were not awarded the penalty at st james ' i 'm not a fan of managers focusing on referees but i have a lot of sympathy with everton boss roberto martinez when he said this ahead of their monday night game with west bromwich albion : ` they -lrb- pgmol -rrb- accept there 's been an honest error made but there have been too many now . ` referees are part of the game and the error of the referee makes the game what it is . it 's tough to take when you 've got six or seven big calls which did n't go your way and scorelines could have changed . ' i still believe martinez needs to address his own shortcomings before he tries to think he knows what 's best for match officials , but he has a point nonetheless . everton have had some shocking decisions go against them this season -- notably at manchester city in the premier league defeat last month . everton manager roberto martinez has had his fair share of decisions going against him . so this weekend i decided to study four games at random to see how bad the situation was . in each game , there were decisions that were n't just questionable , they were downright terrible : . 1 . the inexplicable offside decision which robbed jan vertonghen and spurs of a goal against sunderland . it was high drama right at the end , so the fans were also robbed of a brilliant moment . if you 've seen the incident you 'll know how bad it is . the linesman remembered one important rule about needing two opponents between the ` attacker ' and the goal , but he forgot the even more basic law that you ca n't be offside in your own half . the referee chris foy was in the vicinity as well , but failed to overrule a ridiculous decision . this is a linesman and a referee either not knowing the laws of the game , or forgetting them during the 90 minutes . either way , it 's poor from both . replays clearly showed jan vertonghen was inside his own half as he ran clear to score a disallowed goal . the belgian 's celebrations were cut short when assistant stuart burt inexplicably flagged for offside . belgium defender vertonghen could n't believe his bad luck but tottenham still went on to win the match . 2 . jose fonte 's handball in the late stages of southampton 's victory at newcastle . referee bobby madley had a clear view from a good position , so what was he watching ? how could he possibly interpret that handball as anything other than a penalty ? 3 . bobby madley 's brother andy also took up a good position on a set-piece as nottingham forest threatened derby county . but despite staring straight at derby 's jake buxton grabbing hold of forest 's michail antonio and hauling him to the floor , madley decided not to award a penalty . he let play continue . what was he watching ? jose fonte went unpunished for this clear handball despite referee bobby madley having a clear view . newcastle 's emmanuel riviere protested to referee madley , who waves his appeals away . despite riviere 's impassioned appeals to the official , newcastle were not awarded the penalty . 4 . mike jones awarded handball against leicester 's wes morgan earlier this season at anfield when the ball clearly hit the defender 's face , so the official has found himself demoted to the championship where the nightmare continues -lrb- in fairness , he was faultless when reffing the fa cup tie between blyth spartans and birmingham earlier this month -rrb- . wes morgan was penalised even though the ball clearly hit his face as raheem sterling attacked for liverpool . on saturday , jones was at the dw stadium to control wigan 's 1-1 draw with blackburn . wigan 's james mcclean charged towards rovers ' marcus olsson , lunged in late after the ball had gone and took the defender off his feet . it was a horrible challenge , potential leg-breaker and understandably the blackburn players were livid . jones decided it was only worthy of a yellow card . the linesman was maybe more to blame -- he was right on top of the incident . it 's a clear red card , so why did n't jones give it ? to make matters worse , mcclean headed wigan 's equaliser later in the game . wigan 's james mcclean -lrb- pictured -rrb- charged towards blackburn 's marcus olsson but went unpunished . so why are these glaring errors happening more and more ? honest mistakes are fine , but these are the kind of blunders which if translated and applied to other jobs would get people sacked or killed . a lorry driver does n't look properly as he approaches a roundabout -- it 's potentially fatal . if i do n't know broadcasting law , i might say something i 'm not allowed to and i get sacked from talksport . so why are so many officials failing to do their jobs properly ? these are n't dishonest mistakes of course , but they fall way below the standard that should be set in a professional industry . my theory is this : goal-line technology has come in and been a success -lrb- expensive of course and it is n't used anywhere near as often as its advocates led us to believe it would be , but it 's been a positive -rrb- . the arrival of technology has changed the mindset of officials . i think subconsciously some referees and linesmen have ` downed tools ' and stopped doing their jobs properly , stopped concentrating , stopped watching the game closely . why ? because they want more technology to come in so they can wash their hands of any responsibility . they know they 'll still get paid as professional refs , but they also know there will be less pressure on them as individuals because they 'll be able to refer incidents to a ` video ref . ' back to basics please . ref it right , or ref off . vincent kompany reacts after mike dean blows his whistle to award a penalty to arsenal at the etihad . kompany was not happy with the decision by referee dean at the etihad as it gave arsenal a vital lead .	 premier league referees have been getting big decisions wrong lately .   do they know the laws of the game ? are they watching properly ?   mike dean awarded arsenal a controversial penalty against manchester city but questions have been asked as to whether he was even looking .   referees can often be used as a scapegoat by managers but the officials are doing themselves no favours .

463	on tv : labour peer lord falconer -lrb- pictured -rrb- appeared on bbc one to discuss plans for an assisted suicide law , but nobody represented the opposing view . the bbc has been accused of bias in its coverage of assisted suicide by a campaigner whose tv appearance was cancelled at the last minute . a christian doctor was due to oppose labour peer lord falconer when he appeared on the bbc one breakfast show to discuss his plans for an assisted dying law . but he was then told that he was no longer needed , and lord falconer appeared on the programme alone . dr peter saunders , the campaigner director of anti-euthanasia group care not killing , has complained to the corporation after a planned appearance on the show to challenge lord falconer was called off . the two had previously discussed the issue on the today programme in 2012 . in a letter sent to bbc director general tony hall , seen by the sunday telegraph , dr saunders said the corporation had : ` consistently promoted an agenda seeking to change the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia ' . he added : ` the bbc has consistently acted as the . cheerleader for legalising assisted suicide , a move that would lead to . huge pressure on the terminally ill and disabled to end their lives . ' dr saunders has also claimed that the majority of medical opinion is against a change in the law to support assisted suicide . the bbc has attracted numerous complaints in recent years over the prominence it has given to ` right to die ' programmes - which are often very emotive . a programme called choosing to die , presented to novelist and campaigner sir terry pratchett , who has alzheimer 's disease , attracted 1,200 complaints when it was aired in 2011 . the programme followed a 71-year-old man who suffered from motor neurone disease , and showed the last moments of his life in a dignitas assisted suicide clinic in switzerland . campaigner : sir terry pratchett , pictured , presented an emotive programme on assisted suicide which attracted more than 1,000 complaints . in 2010 a group of mps said the corporation ` misused public funds ' and ` ignored the rights of the disabled ' in a commons motion which threatened to cut the bbc 's public funding unless the issue was ` treated impartially ' . a bbc spokesperson said : ` assisted suicide is an emotive subject which divides opinion . ` after much discussion within the editorial team it was felt that a single interview , in which lord falconer could be questioned fully on his views and proposals would be more suitable on this occasion . ` our presenters strongly challenged his views and were careful to include the views of groups like ` care not killing ' during the interview . '	 labour 's lord falconer discussed assisted dying plans unopposed on bbc .   anti-euthanasia campaigner dr peter saunders was due to appear on show .   however , he was dropped and nobody was invited to take his place . 
464	it is now seven years since ron dennis was asked what he considered the biggest difference between managing the rivalry of senna and prost in the late 1980s and the then current enmity of hamilton and alonso . ` the internet , ' he said . it struck me as an extraordinarily insignificant development for the boss of mclaren to be worrying about amid a multi-million-pound budget , a world championship fight and spygate . video scroll down to watch hamilton drive a reliant robin and rosberg 's driving selfie . tension ? leiws hamilton tweeted -lrb- below -rrb- that he and nico rosberg are ` still friends ' and had ups and downs . but i now feel he was on to something relevant that has advanced at speed in the intervening years . social media , most pertinently twitter , has taken off , for the most part widening rather than deepening the debate -lrb- or so i would contend as a hopeless reactionary -rrb- . everyone is an instant expert , even from his armchair . whether social media is good or bad , how an organisation , for our purposes an f1 team , delivers its news , controls its message and engages with its fans has changed irrevocably . we saw this when lewis hamilton tweeted that he had ` no problem ' with his mercedes team-mate nico rosberg , having publicly fallen out with him at monaco last weekend over qualifying . ` we 've been friends a long time , ' said hamilton . ` as friends we have our ups and downs . today we spoke and we 're cool . still friends . ' as i wrote in a separate news piece about this on friday , the timing of the announcement was odd . i shall elaborate on my understanding of what happened in the hours leading to hamilton 's tweet . i spoke to niki lauda , the mercedes chairman , friday morning . he said : ` i have to tell you that everything is fully under control . everything is back in order . ` i spoke to lewis he said he would speak to nico . from my point of view there are no negatives . ' those quotes , and others from lauda , were going to form the main item in this column . to check a couple of points , i phoned a mercedes spokesman . i specifically asked whether the two drivers had yet talked to each other . the spokesman said he did not know and thought it unlikely he could find out because hamilton , he thought , was travelling across the atlantic ahead of next weekend 's race in canada . odd timing : hamilton 's tweet came at an odd juncture - after niki lauda had announced the pair had spoken . just over an hour later , sky issued a tweet encouraging viewers to contribute to a debate , on the f1 show , tackling the fractious relationship between hamilton and rosberg . eleven minutes after sky 's tweet , came hamilton 's tweet . so , were any of the events connected ? did mercedes ' corporate types want to take control of the agenda , rather than let lauda , who i suspect they think is too prone to go freelance with his views , set it ? did they wish to steer sky 's treatment of the subject towards a discussion of a rapprochement ? mercedes deny it , of course . the same spokesman told me that lewis tweeted independently of them , purely to reflect the updated situation . the spokesman 's revised estimate of lewis ' itinerary was that he was ` probably ' travelling to canada this weekend . under control : mercedes chairman niki lauda claimed everything was fine between the pair . i do n't know whether my suspicions that mercedes had a hand in the tweet are right -- and who can blame them if they did ? it is someone 's job to have the acumen to do so . a legitimate complaint from a journalist would be if the spokesman reacted to my call -- in which i let him into the fact that lauda had spoken to me -- by feeding a tweet to every rival and so ruining the exclusivity of my story , such as it was . a final thought . did hamilton send his tweet -- and choose the perfect picture of himself and rosberg on unicycles as boys to illustrate a long and fun association -- all on his own ? did he not run it by anyone at the office of simon fuller , his manager ? or anyone at mercedes ? i find it difficult to believe that he neglected to do so given the sensitivity of the last few days . that is the way communications work these days . we should at least be aware of this . we can then evaluate sensibly what is said , by whom , and how and when . denial : the german team deny there was anything untoward about the timing of hamilton 's tweet . it is interesting to conjecture what the reaction would have been had hamilton prevented rosberg 's flying lap rather than the other way around . i suspect some fans would be split along tribal lines , just as they are now ; that the stewards would have approached the incident as neutrally as they could ; and that commentators , among them ex-drivers , would still try to be honest in their reading of it . but if hamilton were judged less sympathetically would that entirely be the fault of us observers ? for he has been attracted to controversy like a baby to milk throughout his formula one career ; rosberg has been squeaky-clean . not that there are not upsides to hamilton 's headline-grabbing deeds , good and bad . only last week he was named the world 's most marketable sportsman . his story in the round makes him what the american 's call ` box office ' . squeaky clean : rosberg has a clean record in comparison to hamilton , who has attracted controversy . in his spare days between defending himself against bribery charges in a munich court , bernie ecclestone has been trying to sell shares belonging to the sport 's largest shareholders , cvc . but i can reveal that talks with canadian fashion tycoon lawrence stroll , whose interest in buying into f1 was first reported by sky , have broken down . with f1 's other investors nervous about ecclestone 's future , the sport 's future remains in flux . derek warwick , the driver steward in monaco , explained to sportsmail how the panel came to their decision not to penalise rosberg . i have read that offering this explanation in print and online compromised his independence . no , that is a non-sequitur . i am more inclined to thank him for his transparency . i liked graeme lowdon 's line after his driver jules bianchi 's ninth place for marussia last weekend . ` trust us to score our first points in monaco -- we ca n't afford to celebrate , ' he said , hinting humorously at his team 's belief that they do not receive an equitable share of the sport 's profits . but am i alone in detecting an irony in what lowdon -- who is grandiloquently called marussia 's president -- said ? running formula one cars in the plutocrats ' playground of monaco is hardly the breadline . off the mark : jules bianchi fianlly scored marussa 's first points after finishing ninth in monaco .	 niki lauda told me the hamilton and rosberg had spoken .   but that was at odds with a mercedes spokesman telling me that the british driver was likely on a plane to canada .   the pair have been feuding all season .   but has the team made sure , publicly at least , that everything is fine ? 
465	like a king with a royal proclamation , the inventor of the gif file format has put an end to all debate over how his invention 's name shall be pronounced . or so he wishes . ` it is a soft `` g , '' pronounced `` jif . '' end of story , ' said steve wilhite . the man who gave the world the quintessential meme-making file type hath spoken . but was there really that much question ? in a word : yes . so says he : steven wilhite , inventor of the gif , accepts a webby lifetime achievement award may 21 . he says his invention is pronounced with a soft ` g. ' once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts , how to properly say gif has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images . it has since become synonymous , with the help of a famous dancing baby , with brief and catchy animated images . you need only visit a tumblr page or peruse any buzzfeed article to see how ubiquitous the once nerdy name has become . and you need only run a google search for ` how to pronounce ' to see how active the pronunciation war remains . before you 've even hit the ` g , ' the engine has already guessed what you were thinking . the internet is rampant with websites , blogs , and articles dedicated to the question of how to pronounce the shortened form of graphics interchange format . choosy : an image by the heavy gif users at buzzfeed concurs , likeing the pronunciation to that of the ubiquitous peanut butter . a tumblr dedicated to the question exists , though it comes to no solid conclusion . there is also the gif pronunciation page , which takes the side of mr. wilhite , who purportedly uses the mnemonic device ` choosy developers choose gif , ' to remind everyone it 's a soft ` g ' just like the peanut butter . there 's also a youtube video on the subject . even the president of the united states has taken a stand . when the white house debuted its own tumblr page in april , it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog . among the offerings was ` animated gifs -lrb- hard `` g '' -rrb- ' . and that is , if you were wondering , the other way to speak the term . a hard ` g ' like in ` gift . ' partisanship : barack obama , disagrees . the official white house tumblr promises ` animated gifs -lrb- hard `` g '' -rrb- ' but do n't mention that to wilhite . and do n't try to say both are correct , either . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations , ' mr. wilhite said in an email interview with the new york times . ` they are wrong . ' wilhite 's invention has won him much praise over the last 25 years and even more in the last five or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the web . wilhite was even honored tuesday with a lifetime achievement webb award in recognition of inventing the file format . in the words of the official webby website : . ` the proliferation of the gif within today 's meme-powered , tumblr-driven pop culture , proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the web -lrb- despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation -rrb- . with 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the gif we think the 17th annual webby awards is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate steve wilhite and this historical achievement . ' brave : but even in the face of tyranny and elitism , the gif 's inventor stands firm . ` the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations ' he said . ¿ they are wrong . ¿ .	 steven wilhite accepted a life time achievement webby award on may 21 for giving the gift of the gif to the world . 
466	therapy traditionally consists of sitting on a comfortable sofa while pouring your heart out to a counsellor . but in this digital age , online therapy is just as beneficial - if not more so - than conventional therapy . according to a new study from the university of zurich , therapy sessions carried out online have become increasingly common in recent years . death of the therapist 's couch ? a new study found that online therapy is more effective than the traditional face-to-face kind . many sites , like breakthrough.com and california live visit , have created a network of therapists who use instant messages , emails and even video chats to help their patients . to investigate how effective this method was , researchers asked six therapists to treat 62 patients suffering from moderate depression . after being randomly divided into two groups , one was treated online - through email or instant messenger - while the other received face-to-face therapy . both groups received eight sessions consisting of cognitive therapy techniques . speaking about the results , professor andreas maercker said : ` in both groups , the depression values fell significantly . ' online treatment : researchers put its success down , in part , to the paper trail it generates . fifty-three per cent of those treated online were no longer diagnosed with depression , compared to 50 per cent of those who had face-to-face therapy . during follow-up sessions , it was found that rates of recovery among those treated online were higher than the patients who saw counsellors in person . at the end of the study , 57 per cent of patients who underwent online treatment were free of depression , compared to 42 per cent of those who had traditional therapy . researchers put the online success down , in part , to the paper trail it generated . patients were able to re-read the correspondence with their therapist , keeping it fresh in their mind , whereas those who had real-life therapy quickly forgot advice given . maercker added : ` in the medium term , online psychotherapy yields even better results . ` our study is evidence that psychotherapeutic services on the internet are an effective supplement to therapeutic care . '	 university of zurich found virtual therapy more successful than face-to-face sessions .   fifty-seven per cent of online patients completed course depression free .   only 42 per cent of cases who saw therapist in person felt better .   down to paper trail : online subjects looked over notes from time to time . 
467	it is seen by some as a flaw . for others , an adorable facial feature . and for an increasing number of women all over the world , dimples are so desirable , they are willing to have surgery to achieve them . ` people like dimples , it 's a unique group , a tremendous interest in it and we are surprised by the people who want to have dimples , ' dr amiya prasad , a new york-based cosmetic surgeon , tells fox 10 news . dimpleplasty , as it 's known , has been around for some 30 years , but it has gained popularity in recent times - thanks in part to dimple-cheeked celebrity icons like kate middleton - and is one of the more affordable cosmetic procedures available today . easy job : dr prasad , a new york-based cosmetic surgeon , performs this dimpleplasty in just half an hour , to give lee williams -lrb- center -rrb- the cherubic grin she 's always longed for . at a cost of between $ 1,200 and $ 2,500 , depending on the surgeon , the surgery takes only half an hour and is performed as an outpatient procedure . the incision is made inside the cheek , so there is no scar and , according to dr prasad , ` hardly any swelling or soreness . ' one of his patients , lee williams , spent a year considering it , before ultimately going under the scalpel , and for her , it 's all about attaining more of a cherubic grin . ' i . just want someone to perk me up a little bit , make me a little cuter , a . little more of a remember-able smile , ' she says . and sure enough , a . quick snip and a few stitches later - she is the proud owner of set of . unmistakable dimples . it 's not just those pearly whites : kate middleton -lrb- pictured -rrb- is the proud owner of a pronounced pair of dimples , which certainly accentuate her beaming smile . under the knife : ms williams says she wants the surgery to ` perk ' her up , make her ` cuter ' and give her a more memorable smile . from drab to fab ! ms williams before she underwent the surgery -lrb- left -rrb- and three days later -lrb- right -rrb- displaying no swelling or redness . the process involves first marking with a pen where her natural dimples would be , by measuring from the corner of her eye down to her cheek . ` there 's kind of a sweet spot where the skin will naturally give us permission to fold in a little bit and look more natural , ' explains dr prasad . he points out that many of his patients with ` round faces ' get the procedure done because of the more ` angular ' appearance their face takes on as a result of the surgery - creating the illusion that they have lost weight . slimming ? according to dr prasad -lrb- another of his patients pictured -rrb- , many women with ` round ' faces opt to have dimpleplasty to create the illusion that they have lost weight . dimple icons : a-listers including kristen dunst -lrb- left -rrb- and miranda kerr -lrb- right -rrb- have spurned the trend with their admittedly adorable cheeky smiles . naturally occurring dimples , as in the case of jennifer garner -lrb- left -rrb- and leighton meester -lrb- right -rrb- are in fact a genetically inherited defect in the cheek muscles . dimples occur in both sexes , can be one-sided or symmetrical , and are commonly inherited as a dominant genetic trait . according to dr aharnov , a californian-based dimpleplasty specialist , natural dimples are technically a flaw in the facial structure ; ` formed when there is a small defect in the cheek musculature . ' still , for the likes of kate middleton , jennifer garner and miranda kerr , to name a few , dimples are part of their winning charm . designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years . but some surgeons are warning against the procedure . a spokesman for plastic surgeons surgicare stated two years ago : ` as the skin ages and loses elasticity , there is no telling how the scars will look as the face begins to droop . ` designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years . ' which spells bad news for anyone who wishes to change their mind ; as this latest celebrity-inspired trend in plastic surgery is not reversible .	 lee williams , a patient in new york , opted for the surgery to make her ' a little cuter '   dimpleplasty starts at $ 1,200 and takes only half an hour to perform as an out-patient procedure .   natural dimples are actually a birth defect resulting from a shortened facial muscle .

469	a new type of solar cloud has been discovered emanating from the sun . the magnetic cloud is a smaller version of larger clouds of particles known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections , which can produce auroras on earth . and the finding could apparently help us understand how such space weather affects our planet . dr janvier from the university of dundee has discovered a new solar cloud . solar clouds are groups of particles emitted by the sun into space , often as coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- , shown . this latest finding is smaller than comparable cmes . but she says it could help us understand how space weather affects earth . the discovery was made by dr miho janvier from the university of dundee together with pascal démoulin of the lesia observatoire de paris in france , and sergio dasso at the university of buenos aires . she made the discovery while looking at matter expelled from the sun and thrown out into space . ` our work has been studying how solar flares are generated and the effects they cause , ' explained dr janvier , reports the bbc . ` we already knew there were these large magnetic clouds generated by solar flares . ` we also knew that smaller magnetised structures existed , but what we have found is that they have a completely different origin . the earth 's magnetic field could flip in just 100 years , researchers have found . the move , which would mean all compasses pointed south instead of north , was thought to take thousands of years . however , a new study found it can happen far faster . the new study by a team of scientists from italy , france , columbia university and the university of california , berkeley , demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal 786,000 years ago actually happened very quickly , in less than 100 years - roughly a human lifetime . the discovery comes as new evidence indicates that the intensity of earth 's magnetic field is decreasing 10 times faster than normal , leading some geophysicists to predict a reversal within a few thousand years . ` these smaller clouds have different characteristics which mean they must be generated in a different place and/or in a different way . ` they must be coming from the sun but we are not sure yet where in the sun 's atmosphere they are being born . ' she explained to mailonline the finding is comparable to hurricanes and regular storms on earth . in this instance coronal mass ejections are much larger clouds of particles , whereas these new ` flux ropes ' are much smaller . their size can be one tenth the earth-sun distance , but they are thought to be much more numerous on the sun than larger coronal mass ejections . but she adds : ` we did n't just see one cloud , it was a population of smaller clouds . ' solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds of up to 370 miles -lrb- 600 kilometres -rrb- per second . when they arrive at earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the iss . solar clouds are storms of energised particles sent across the solar system at speeds approaching that of light . when they arrive at earth they can cause geomagnetic storms and auroras -lrb- shown -rrb- , and pose a potential danger to satellites and even astronauts on the iss . numerous spacecraft are in orbit around the sun to observe these events , including nasa 's twin stereo spacecraft . the two probes observe the sun simultaneously to produce stereoscopic images and observe solar phenomena including coronal mass ejections - commonly associated with solar storms . however , the agency announced the other day that they had lost contact with stereo b -lrb- ` behind ' -rrb- , putting the mission in jeopardy . ` communications with the stereo behind spacecraft were interrupted on 1 october , immediately after a planned reset of the spacecraft performed as part of a test of solar conjunction operations , ' nasa said . ` the cause of the anomaly is not yet known , though a sensor anomaly in the guidance and control system is suspected . attempts to recover the spacecraft are continuing .

471	a fisherman from new zealand was left baffled when he caught this see-through shrimp-like creature swimming near the surface of the ocean . stewart fraser was fishing with sons conaugh and finn 43 miles north off the north island 's karikari peninsula when he spotted the translucent ` shrimp ' floating near the top of the water . mr fraser said : ' i was in two minds whether to haul it in , but curiosity got the better of me and i decided to take a closer look . this translucent shrimp-like creature was caught swimming near the surface of the ocean off new zealand . baffled : fisherman stewart fraser holding the see-through shrimp . ` it felt scaly and was quite firm , almost jelly like , and you could n't see anything inside aside from this orange little blob inside it . the photo baffled mr fraser and all of his fisherman friends , who are still none more the wise as to what the creature could have been . one theory to explain the mysterious fish is that it could be a salpa maggiore - a kind of marine invertebrate . salps , as they are more commonly known , are found in both equatorial and cold seas , so the waters around new zealand 's karikari peninsula would be more than suitable for the translucent sea creature . they are spotted swimming alone just as often as they are seen in long , string-like colonies , and move by pumping water through their gelatinous bodies . as a harmless creature that feeds only on plankton , a salp 's see-through body is believed to be designed to avoid it being spotted by predators when floating near the surface . one remarkable species survival technique is the ability to create a clone of itself when food is abundant , which then grow at the fastest rate of any multicellular creature . mr fraser said : ` we have no idea what it could have been but it was quite something and i 'd never seen anything like it before . ' however , deborah cracknell , research lead from the national marine aquarium in plymouth , told mailonline she believes the creature is a salpa maggiore -lrb- salpa maxima -rrb- . paul cox , director of conservation and communication at the national marine aquarium , said : ` little is known about these salps , however , they are often found in colder seas , with the most abundant concentration found in the southern ocean . ` the salp is barrel-shaped and moves by contracting , pumping water through its gelatinous body . ` it strains the water through its internal feeding filters , feeding on phytoplankton from the upper sunlit layer of the ocean . ` they have an interesting life-cycle with alternate generations existing as solitary individuals or groups forming long chains . ` in common with other defenceless animals that occupy open water - jellies and hydroids for example - the translucence presumably provides some protection from predation . being see-through is a pretty good camouflage in water . ' mr fraser , was fishing with sons conaugh and finn 70kms north of the karikari peninsula when he spotted the mysterious shrimp .	 stewart fraser was fishing 43 miles north off the karikari peninsula .   he plucked the bizarre creature from the water and took a photo .   it has baffled mr fraser and all of his fisherman friends .   but aquarium tells mailonline the creature is called a salpa maggiore .

473	a jobcentre adviser who smashed her car into a lamp-post after finishing a bottle of wine has been cleared of drink-driving after a judge accepted she had been sleepwalking . becky mason , 28 , was arrested and failed a breath test after staggering from the wreck of her peugeot 307 in her pyjamas . it later emerged that minutes earlier she had driven to work -- even though it was saturday night -- where an incredulous security guard told her the office was shut for the weekend . relieved : becky mason was cleared of the charges against her after it was proved that she had been fast asleep when she got in the car drunk . now , after an extraordinary legal battle , miss mason has been acquitted after a court found she had been asleep the whole time and therefore could n't be held responsible for her actions . unbeknown to her , it turned out she had been suffering from sleepwalking episodes for years . her defence was backed by a leading sleep expert who has previously gone to court to debunk claims by murderers and rapists that they were asleep at the time of their crimes . on the day of the crash , miss mason had awoken early , because she was worrying about an appointment she had concerning voluntary work . ` i struggle to sleep anyway , and on the day of the crash i 'd been awake since 6am , ' she said . ` later on i had a friend round to my . home and we both had a few glasses of wine and did karaoke together.then . the next thing i knew i was getting out of my car after crashing into a . lamp-post . ' witnesses described the psychology graduate as appearing ` confused ' after the crash , which she escaped with only a graze to her hand , thanks to her car 's airbags . breath tests found 96mg of alcohol per 100ml -- nearly three times the legal limit of 35mg -- and she told officers she had obviously been drink-driving . but after telling solicitor derek millard-smith she had no memory of getting into the car and ` it felt like committing a crime in my sleep ' , he set about investigating further . in law , sleepwalking -- or automatism -- is a defence against committing a criminal act as there is no conscious act of will involved . shortly before the crash , at about 10pm on saturday , february 11 this year , miss mason had arrived at the jobcentre in knowsley , merseyside , where she is a customer service adviser -- a five-mile journey from her liverpool home . the security guard -- whose evidence was to prove crucial in the case -- pointed out to the pyjama-clad miss mason that she was n't due in for another 36 hours , and she left again . miss mason now believes that after falling asleep on the sofa , she had been disturbed by the noise of her housemates shutting the front door as they went out , and got into her car without waking up . an expert examining the case concluded she crashed because she was actually moving into a phase of deeper sleep . he . said evidence that both miss mason and -- she has now learnt -- other . family members had previously sleepwalked supported the theory . trigger : it is believed the noise of her housemate shutting the door disturbed her sleep and make her get up and get in her car . this week at liverpool magistrates court , district judge miriam shelvey said she was ` satisfied that the defendant did drive while in a state of parasomnia ' , or disordered sleep . yesterday miss mason -- originally from mid wales -- told the daily mail : ` it really has n't sunk in yet -- it 's been the worst year of my life and i 'm so relieved it 's all over . ` i would never in a million years drink and drive ; in fact i 've always been strongly against it . ` i had no idea i might have been sleepwalking , but the more we pieced things together , the more it made sense . a few weeks later i was due to go to alton towers , and i woke up at 3am and realised i 'd been putting my make-up on in my sleep . ' miss mason -- who could not get legal aid and had to fund her defence through a family inheritance -- now gives a friend ` custody ' of her car keys when she 's asleep to prevent a repeat . neuropsychiatrist dr jonathan bird said it was the first time in 26 years specialising in sleep disorders that he had gone to court to support an account of sleepwalking . ` her experience is at the extreme end of parasomnia , but the evidence strongly showed that she had indeed been asleep right up until the crash , ' he told the mail . mr millard-smith , of hill dickinson solicitors , said he too had no doubt miss mason had been asleep , saying : ` the message is not you can get away with drink-driving if you advance sleepwalking as a defence , but that the justice system does work in the event of genuine circumstances .

' but sir les , in an interview with the times educational supplement , said the focus on universities meant schools risked ignoring vocational courses and apprenticeships which could be better for pupils who should be ` choosing the subjects in which they excel and enjoy ' . he said schools should be encouraging students to take ` the most appropriate route to realise their full potential ' and warned that society ` really undervalues apprenticeships ' . sir les said black and ethnic minority pupils were pressured into applying for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite being over-subscribed . sir les added : ` one of our problems is there 's such a dreadful snobbery about whether people go to university or which university they go to . ` i would hate to see that work through into undue pressure on schools . ' he said black and minority ethnic students are put under pressure by their parents to apply for medicine and law courses at oxford and cambridge , despite those courses being some of the most over-subscribed . ` this is one of the reasons that some groups are underrepresented at some universities . we should be treating people as individuals . ` this perceived feeling in our society that to be a doctor or lawyer is a high-status profession that black people aspire to for their children ... there 's nothing wrong with it , but the most important thing is that students should be encouraged to fulfil their full potential in whatever subject that is .

' mr gove wants exam boards to compete for the chance to produce the new english , maths and science papers . ministers plan to change the marking system so the new ` o-levels ' will not be norm-referenced , meaning that top grades would not be limited to a fixed proportion of pupils . the current a to g grading system for english , maths and science is also set to be scrapped and replaced with a numerical system such as 1 to 5 . ` otherwise it will be too confusing with all the as and bs and -lrb- people asking -rrb- did you get an a before the change or after the change ? , ' said the source . the proposals come just days after a inquiry by a committee of mps found that exam standards have dropped because boards are competing to offer the easier papers . nansi ellis , of the association of teachers and lecturers , said mr gove needed to ask himself whether there was any evidence that any proposed changes , ` will benefit learning and the acquisition and development of skills ' .	 a similar distribution marking system is used by cambridge pre-u qualification .   the plan forms part of an overhaul of the exams system for 16-year-olds .

483	the los angeles times reported tuesday afternoon that lois lerner , who heads up the internal revenue service 's tax-exempt division , plans to invoke the fifth amendment to the u.s. constitution in a hearing wednesday before the house committee on oversight and government affairs . the fifth amendment provides that u.s. citizens may not be compelled to offer testimony if telling the truth would incriminate them . lerner 's defense lawyer , william w. taylor iii , wrote to the committee on tuesday that his client would refuse to answer questions related to what she knew about the extra levels of scrutiny applied to conservative nonprofit organizations that applied for tax-exempt status beginning in 2010 . lois lerner heads the irs 's exempt organizations division . her lawyer says she will plead the fifth amendment on wednesday to avoid answering questions about her agency 's tea party scandal during a congressional hearing . irs headquarters in washington , d.c. is fast becoming the epicenter of the tea party probe , despite an inspector general report that focused on employees in cincinnati , ohio . she also will decline to say why she did n't disclose what she knew to congress , according to the la times . lerner . ` has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation , ' taylor 's . letter read , ` but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take . this course . ' he is asking the oversight committee to excuse lerner from testifying , claiming that calling her in a congressional hearing would ` have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her ' since members would not expect her to answer questions . ahmad ali , a committee spokesman , told mailonline that ` ms. lerner remains under subpoena from chairman issa to appear at tomorrow 's hearing - the committee has a constitutional obligation to conduct oversight . ' ` chairman -lsb- darrel -rsb- issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous irs targeting of americans for their political beliefs . ' the irs applied special criteria to conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status , putting them on a ` be on the lookout ' -lrb- bolo -rrb- list , based on the groups ' names and political philosophies . president barack obama has said he was unaware of the program until may 10 , when excerpts of an irs inspector general report on the practice were leaked to reporters . jay carney , the obama administration 's designated flak-catcher , insists that the president did n't know about the irs targeting tea party groups until he learned about it during a tv news broadcast . but jay carney , the president 's chief spokesman , confirmed monday that senior white house staff , including white house counsel kathy ruemmler and chief of staff denis mcdonough , knew about the irs 's habits as early as april 24 , and chose not to tell obama . the inspector general report found that lerner and other irs were notified in or before june 2011 that some staff in the agency 's cincinnati , ohio office were using ` tea party , ' ` patriots ' and other key words to add applicants to the bolo list . once on that list , the groups were subjected to additional auditing of their financial practices , their membership and their political activities . despite knowing about the program , lerner and other senior irs staffers withheld the information from congress despite receiving several requests from house committees whose members heard from constituents that their tea party groups ' tax-exempt approvals were taking as long as two years to be resolved . the house oversight and government affairs committee was among those that specifically asked the irs whether it was inspecting tea party groups more closely than other applicants , including those on the political left . under mounting pressure , president barack obama announced may 15 in the east room of the white house that acting irs commissioner steven miller would be stepping down . it emerged hours later , however , that miller 's term as acting commissioner was already scheduled to end in early june . lerner herself launched her agency 's scandal with a planted question-and-answer exchange during a may 10 american bar association conference . asked the pre-arranged question , lerner responded by conceding that her employees had acted inappropriately . ` instead of referring to the cases as advocacy cases , they actually used case names on this list , ' she told the assembled tax lawyers . ` they used names like `` tea party '' or `` patriots , '' and they selected cases simply because the applications had those names in the title.that was wrong . that was absolutely incorrect , insensitive , and inappropriate -- that 's not how we go about selecting cases for further review . ' she later claimed that the increase in scrutiny of tea party groups was due to an influx of new applications from right-wing organizations , following the supreme court 's ` citizens united ' ruling , which opened the floodgates to greater political participation by nonprofit advocacy groups . the washington post called that claim bogus , however , with the newspaper 's fact checker awarding it a ` four pinocchios ' rating for dishonesty . four pinocchios : ` between 2010 and 2012 , we started seeing a very big uptick in the number of 501 -lrb- c -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- applications we were receiving , ' lerner claimed , but the washington post determined that was n't true . lerner 's boss , acting irs commissioner steven miller , was relieved of his post by treasury secretary jack lew last week , although the term of his appointment to the job was already scheduled to end in early june . other higher-ups inside the irs have not been publicly held accountable for the improper targeting of conservative organizations .	 lois lerner faces house committee on oversight and government affairs .   due to be quizzed about extra levels of scrutiny applied to conservative nonprofit organisations that applied for tax-exempt status .   but her lawyer says she will refuse to answer anything that may incriminate her .

''' she added : ` in middle-class families it 's not just about doing well at school , they have to be fabulous all-rounders . ` schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at gcses and a levels . ' the professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children , a fulfilling career and a full social life . ` if you 're being picked on that 's awful , but if you 're just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it ' ` you want to keep them aspirational , but you want them to be confident enough to say , `` i do n't want this '' , if it is too much , ' she said . girls also need to be warned about the ` very serious glass ceiling they could confront , ' she added . in a separate interview , she described research into friendship groups among girls . ` these friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny , excluding those who do n't make the grade , ' she said . ` we need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem , and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention . these are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg .
